<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> the still summer dusk the
night mail for London roared down the long declivity, clashed
into a cutting and forth again, screamed, flashed past the
deserted little station of Dunford, and thundered triumphantly
along the level towards Kitty Carstairs.</p>
<p>Leaning on the fence bounding the track, the girl watched the
tremendous approach with a fascination which custom had failed to
dull.&nbsp; As the monster seemed to leap upon her, her attitude
lost its easy laxness; she stood erect, her white-clad arms
leaving the fence, her slim brown fingers clutching it.&nbsp; A
sensation of oily, steamy warmth, a glimpse of two dark human
figures in a fiery glow&mdash;and the great engine was
past.&nbsp; A whirl of brilliantly-lighted corridors with their
puppet-like occupants, a couple of darkened sleeping-cars, more
carriages, a postal van, a <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>guard&rsquo;s van&mdash;and the train
was gone.&nbsp; A rush of air cooled her delicately-tanned face
and disturbed her unprotected dark hair.&nbsp; Her brown eyes
gazed after the train, and saw the big net swing out from the
postal van, and snatch the little leather-covered bundle from the
iron arm, which Sam the postman had moved into position a minute
earlier.</p>
<p>With a sigh Kitty took her hands from the fence.&nbsp; The
thrill was over, the reaction had come.&nbsp; For a moment she
hesitated.&nbsp; Should she wait for Sam, the postman, as she
sometimes did, and get his honest, cheerful company home?&nbsp;
No, she couldn&rsquo;t be bothered with Sam to-night; she would
sooner run the risk of meeting some one whom she would rather not
meet.</p>
<p>She turned to cross the broad field that stretched between her
and the main road, and found herself face to face with a young
man in light tweeds, well cut but getting shabby.&nbsp; He was
fairly tall, grey-eyed, and inclined to fairness, and his shaven
countenance was decidedly attractive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; he said, with a grave smile, as
though not quite sure of his welcome.</p>
<p>She was startled, but recovered herself as quickly as the
flush left her cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good evening, Mr.
Hayward,&rdquo; she returned in a tone of <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>politeness
softened by kindness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were
in Dunford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came home this afternoon.&nbsp; May I walk a bit of
the way with you?&mdash;that is if you
aren&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped short.</p>
<p>Following his gaze she saw the figure of a man crossing the
field in their direction.&nbsp; She frowned slightly, saying:
&ldquo;You know your people won&rsquo;t like it, Mr.
Hayward.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then hurriedly&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to have to speak to Mr. Symington&mdash;if that&rsquo;s he
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stay with you, Kitty, for it&rsquo;s
certainly Symington.&nbsp; Ah, he&rsquo;s turning back.&nbsp; One
would almost think he had heard you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t possibly hear me at that distance,
unless in his mind,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you had
better not call me &lsquo;Kitty,&rsquo; Mr. Hayward,&rdquo; she
added.&nbsp; It was more an appeal than a command.</p>
<p>He made no reply, and they walked a little way in
silence.&nbsp; He was first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you still go down to watch the London mail run
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t miss many evenings, but then,
you know, it&rsquo;s the one sensation of this place&mdash;to me,
at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time I ever saw you was at the <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>fence
there&mdash;five years ago, it must have been.&nbsp; Your hair
was in a pigtail and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sixteen then, and now I&rsquo;m&mdash;about
sixty.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed rather drearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the last time I saw you, three months ago, you were
there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no doubt if you come back in a hundred years, Mr.
Hayward, you&rsquo;ll find me there again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was glad to see you there to-night,
Kitty&mdash;please don&rsquo;t forbid me to be friendly.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m feeling particularly friendless at present.&nbsp;
Indeed, I think you might be kinder than call me &lsquo;Mr.
Hayward.&rsquo;&nbsp; What&rsquo;s wrong with
&lsquo;Colin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ignored the question, but said kindly
enough&mdash;&ldquo;If you are in trouble, I&rsquo;m sorry, and I
hope it&rsquo;s not serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve failed in my final&mdash;for the second
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Colin!&rdquo; she exclaimed, sympathy putting an
end to formality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Kitty.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the most comforting
thing I&rsquo;ve heard since I came home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely they weren&rsquo;t hard on you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Kitty&rsquo;s social position was several steps down from that of
Colin&rsquo;s people, but behind her words lurked the suspicion,
not based entirely on fancy, that the Haywards might have been
very hard indeed on the youngest son and brother.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>&ldquo;Oh, I daresay I deserved the dressing-down I
got,&rdquo; he returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see my parents,
brothers, and sisters take my failure as a sort of public
affront.&nbsp; My brothers have been brilliant, and because two
of them became a minister and a lawyer without any apparent
trouble, my father can&rsquo;t see why I have not become a doctor
with equal ease and speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never wanted to be a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the point, Kitty.&nbsp; I was expected to
become one.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve struggled through four
professionals, but Providence&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no doubt about its
being Providence&mdash;says I&rsquo;ve gone far enough for
humanity&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you are not going to try again?&rdquo;
she asked after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&nbsp; And that has added to the trouble at
home.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m twenty-five, and I told them that I could
not go on wasting more years at a thing I was plainly not adapted
for.&nbsp; They insisted that I should go on, and I respectfully
but firmly refused.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Colin?&rdquo;&mdash;anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to imagine,&rdquo; he said
slowly, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m thinking any evil of my
people.&nbsp; I understand their feelings, their pride, and so
on, well enough; but they don&rsquo;t understand me one <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>little
bit.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m going to look for something to do that
doesn&rsquo;t require a university brain.&nbsp; To begin with,
I&rsquo;m going to London&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;London!&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still hankering, Kitty?&rdquo; he gently inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind me.&nbsp; Please tell me more&mdash;if you
want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any more.&nbsp; If you are watching
the train to-morrow night, you may see the last of me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be on the look out, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had come to the gate leading to the main road, and by
tacit agreement they halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t quarrelled with your people,
Colin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled queerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t quarrel in our
family&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity.&nbsp; We bottle it up, and of
course that preserves the resentment.&nbsp; So, as far as I can
see, we shall part politely, but I&rsquo;m perfectly well aware
that I needn&rsquo;t trouble to come home again until I can prove
that my way was the right one.&rdquo;&nbsp; His tone changed
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s enough&mdash;too
much&mdash;about my affairs.&nbsp; Tell me something about
yourself, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must go; it&rsquo;s almost
ten, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me come as far as the end of the little
wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>She
hesitated and gave in.&nbsp; It was for the last time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must walk quickly, then,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But their steps lagged in the darkness of the pines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still want to get away from Dunford?&rdquo; he
asked her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does the London train still call
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak about it!&nbsp; And please try to
forget that I ever spoke about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a silly girl
no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought your ideas and ambitions silly,
Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tried to discourage them,&rdquo; she said
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my selfishness.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want you
to go away from Dunford.&nbsp; It may not be a very lively place,
but it&rsquo;s safe.&nbsp; Quite a number of people seem to find
moderate happiness in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The happiness of turnips!&rdquo; she said fiercely,
then laughed sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that wasn&rsquo;t fair of
me,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, you know, before I came
to live with my aunt and uncle here, I always looked forward to
seeing the world and doing something in it, and my father
encouraged me&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no use in going over that
again.&nbsp; <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Some day, perhaps, I&rsquo;ll resign myself to selling
postage stamps, and sending telegrams and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your uncle and aunt still set against your going
elsewhere?&nbsp; Now that you&rsquo;re of age they could hardly
prevent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please say no more, Colin.&nbsp; When you come back
rich or famous, or both, you will find me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not check the words that rushed from his heart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kitty, if I could only hope that I might find you
here&mdash;waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not affect to misunderstand him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really mean that,&rdquo; she said
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are too good friends for that sort of
thing.&nbsp; Yes, I believe we are good friends, although our
friendship has not all been open and straightforward.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve had it, Colin, and I don&rsquo;t want
to be sorry afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never supposed you could love me,&rdquo; he said
sadly, &ldquo;but since you allow the friendship, will you let me
write to you?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the only friend I feel I want to
write to while I&rsquo;m trying to prove that my way is the right
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She considered before she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear
from you, but you must not write.&nbsp; It will only make
trouble.&nbsp; And now I must say good-bye and&mdash;good
luck.&rdquo;&nbsp; She put out her hand.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>He held
it, striving with himself.&nbsp; Then he said a little
unsteadily, &ldquo;I think you must know that I have cared for
you all along, and because I may never see you again, will
you&mdash;will you let me kiss you&mdash;once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Colin, you understand that I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
love you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could just see that his face was white.&nbsp; She made an
almost imperceptible movement, and it was not of refusal.</p>
<p>A moment later he was gone.</p>
<p>When the sound of his footsteps had ceased, Kitty stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I crying?&rdquo; she said to herself, and wiped her
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor Colin, poor boy! I wonder if he will
write, after all.&rdquo;&nbsp; She started for home.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I thought I had sort of got over the London
longing,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<h2><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> taking the path through the wood
she had cut off a wide curve of the main road.&nbsp; She was
nearly home.&nbsp; Already the few remaining lights of the
village bade her welcome back to dullness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five years!&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;and I
may live in it for fifty more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty Carstairs scarcely remembered her mother.&nbsp; She had
been brought&mdash;or allowed to bring herself up&mdash;by her
father, a Glasgow journalist of brilliant parts and erratic
methods, a wretched manager of his worldly affairs, a delightful
guest, an entertaining host, and altogether a very lovable
fellow.&nbsp; Kitty adored him, and ignored his weaknesses and
eccentricities.&nbsp; When he died after a long illness, she
wished she might follow him quickly.&nbsp; He left a little
money, and just enough debts to eat it up, five MSS. of novels,
two collections of travel sketches, and a play&mdash;all in a
more or less unfinished state&mdash;and a letter <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to
Kitty&rsquo;s only relatives, the brother and sister of his dead
wife.</p>
<p>Kitty never saw the contents of that letter; all she knew was
that it seemed to procure her a home with John Corrie and his
sister in the village of Dunford.</p>
<p>For many years John Corrie had been postmaster as well as
proprietor of a flourishing general store, the only shop of
importance in the place.&nbsp; A canny man and a far-sighted was
John Corrie, grasping but not exactly mean.&nbsp; If the
villagers did not love him, they respected his success.&nbsp; He
had &ldquo;got on&rdquo; marvellously.&nbsp; Apart from the store
he owned a mill, bought for an old song from the trustee of a
bankrupt, and a coal yard taken over from an unlucky merchant and
mortgagee.&nbsp; Also he had invested savings in land and
houses.&nbsp; For some years, also, he had indulged in more
speculative transactions.&nbsp; He was a tall, gaunt man with
small, pale blue eyes, a long melancholy nose, a tight mouth, and
high prominent cheek-bones over scanty grizzling whiskers, which
ran into a short untidy beard.&nbsp; His head was quite
bald.&nbsp; He was an abstainer, and a regular attender at public
worship, though not an office-bearer of the church.</p>
<p>His sister Rachel assisted him capably in <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the
store.&nbsp; She may have been a good-looking maiden; now she was
a scraggy, drear-visaged creature with a curiously suspicious
manner and a craze for doing everything precisely as her mother
had done it.&nbsp; She seemed to object to youth discovering or
making use of a new method.&nbsp; She was mean in some ways, but,
perhaps for lack of courage, not so grasping as her
brother.&nbsp; To him she was devoted.</p>
<p>Kitty attended to the post-office which served a district
sparsely populated, but of considerable extent.&nbsp; She had
never received a penny for this.&nbsp; On the other hand her
relations did not grudge her in board, lodging and clothing; and
twice a year they gave her a pound to spend as she liked.&nbsp;
She divided the money on &ldquo;pretty things&rdquo; and
books.&nbsp; Books, by the way, had initiated the friendship
between her and Colin Hayward.&nbsp; He had lent her many, but
only one at a time, for the thing had to be done secretly; but
he, at least, preferred &ldquo;one at a time,&rdquo; since it
meant frequent meetings during his holidays.</p>
<p>As Kitty neared the cottage, which was ancient looking without
but fairly modern within, and which was connected with the store
and post-office, she was suddenly informed by her eyes <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>that the room
on the right of the door was illuminated.&nbsp; Unless on a
Sunday night, it was a rare thing to see a light in the
parlour.&nbsp; The Corries received few visitors, with the
exception of Alec Symington, the owner of White Farm, and a
familiar guest like him was expected to feel at home in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>The girl was uncertain what to do.&nbsp; She rejected the
temptation to steal upstairs to bed; she was not going to let
them think she was afraid of them at this time of day!&nbsp;
Well, there was nothing for it but to go into the kitchen and
wait.&nbsp; Noiselessly she entered and seated herself in a
wicker chair.</p>
<p>A moment later the silence in the opposite room was broken,
and by her aunt&rsquo;s voice raised to an unusual pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more I think on it, John Corrie, the more I see
what a fool ye&rsquo;ve been.&nbsp; To take fifty pound for a
thing that&rsquo;s come worth twenty thousand&mdash;that&rsquo;ll
maybe yet be worth thirty, forty, ay fifty
thousand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, woman!&rdquo;&nbsp; Kitty scarcely
recognized her uncle&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;How could I, or
anybody, ha&rsquo; foreseen that the shares would go up?&nbsp;
Five year ago the broker in Glasgow told us they were
rubbish.&nbsp; Six months ago ye <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>agreed I had done well to get fifty
pound for them from Symington&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he knew what he was doing&mdash;he knew, though you
didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he did.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been
daft about gold mines for years.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been
ruined by now if his father hadna died and left him White
Farm.&nbsp; I tell ye, Rachel, he bought the five thousand shares
off me with his eyes shut, just for a speculation.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t talk!&nbsp; Ye know well ye were as sick-tired as I
was o&rsquo; seeing the certificates lying in the safe, wi&rsquo;
never a ha&rsquo;penny o&rsquo; interest to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, John, we&rsquo;ve been
cheated&mdash;don&rsquo;t care what ye say&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
maybe a judgment on us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&nbsp; Ye mun make the best
o&rsquo; a bad job.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;ll maybe no be so bad in
the end.&rdquo;&nbsp; Corrie let out a laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no complain if we get half o&rsquo; whatever
he gets for the shares, when he sells them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dinna begin on that again.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll never
pay up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, he&rsquo;ll pay up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got his bond
in my pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye didna tell me!&nbsp; How did ye manage
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie replied, but he had lowered his voice <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and only a
murmur reached Kitty&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; She was not interested
in her uncle&rsquo;s affairs generally, but it was something new
to hear of his having been &ldquo;done,&rdquo; for
&ldquo;done&rdquo; was the word that came into her mind the
moment she understood Symington&rsquo;s part in the
business.&nbsp; Eavesdropping, however, was not one of her
weaknesses, and she rose with the intention of making known her
presence in the house.</p>
<p>Just then her aunt&rsquo;s voice rose in a sort of screech of
incredulity&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll never consent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that.&nbsp; Leave it to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the voices became indistinct.&nbsp; In the kitchen
doorway Kitty stopped short.&nbsp; Whom were they talking about
now?&nbsp; Herself?&nbsp; When had her consent ever been asked
for anything?&nbsp; For a few moments she hesitated, tempted to
lay her ear against the parlour door.&nbsp; Then throwing up her
head, she stepped softly along the passage and shut the front
door with a bang.</p>
<p>As she turned from it the parlour door was snatched open, and
her uncle&rsquo;s face peered out.&nbsp; His brow was glistening
and his eyes held gleams of excitement; but his voice was
curiously mild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in here for a minute, Kitty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She followed him into the room, wondering.&nbsp; <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>This was not
the customary reception on her return from seeing the London mail
go by, and she was later to-night than ever she had been.&nbsp;
Her aunt, sitting with folded hands on one side of the
fern-filled hearth, gave her an instant&rsquo;s glance, which
conveyed nothing, and resumed staring at the folded, toil-worn
hands in her lap.&nbsp; Her uncle took his chair on the other
side, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re late, but maybe ye&rsquo;ve
a good reason for that.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may have been a smile
that distorted, for a moment, his thin lips.</p>
<p>Kitty drew a chair from the table, seated herself and
waited.&nbsp; She had learned long ago never to open a
conversation with these two.</p>
<p>Mr. Corrie rubbed his hairy jaw between finger and thumb,
cleared his throat, and said, almost
pleasantly&mdash;&ldquo;Well, did he meet ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an unexpected question, and she could not answer
immediately.</p>
<p>He helped her by adding, &ldquo;Ye needna be shy.&nbsp; Mr.
Symington left here half-an-hour back to look for ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t meet
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strange that her uncle should speak of the man
as &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; No.&rdquo;&nbsp; She repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t meet me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Uncle and aunt
exchanged glances, and the latter asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where were
ye to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the railway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ye didn&rsquo;t see Mr. Symington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I saw him&mdash;at a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause before Mr. Corrie spoke with less smoothness
than previously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye keep away from him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a plain answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;who was wi&rsquo; ye at the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty flushed and went pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Colin
Hayward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; That useless waster!&nbsp; Were ye not
forbidden to ha&rsquo; any acquaintance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s failed again in his examinations!&rdquo;
cried Miss Corrie.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the talk o&rsquo; the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ha&rsquo; ye to say for yourself?&rdquo; roared
her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; came the quiet answer; &ldquo;nothing
that would satisfy you or Aunt Rachel.&nbsp; I had no intention
of meeting Mr. Hayward to-night, but when I did meet him I was
not going to pretend I did not know him because he had failed in
an examination.&nbsp; And before long I <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>was very glad
I had met him, for his presence kept away Mr. Symington.&nbsp;
Now, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll go to
bed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A warning glance from his sister caused Mr. Corrie to strive
for self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit still,&rdquo; he said shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye know
perfectly well it&rsquo;s no the thing for you to be walking
wi&rsquo; one o&rsquo; the Haywards.&nbsp; Mrs. Hayward, as
ye&rsquo;re maybe not unaware, complained about it last
year&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, John,&rdquo; interposed Miss Corrie,
observing the girl&rsquo;s burning cheeks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re as good as the Haywards any day, but
we&rsquo;d best forget that affair.&nbsp; Now that Kitty&rsquo;s
heard about it, she&rsquo;ll know what to do in
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty mastered the quiver of her pretty mouth, and with a
quick movement brushed the tears from her dark eyes, and looked
straight at her uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me at once,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what
Mr. Symington wanted with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The directness of the question had a disconcerting effect on
Mr. Corrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you could guess,&rdquo; he mumbled at last.</p>
<p>Kitty ignored the invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d best tell her, Rachel,&rdquo; said Mr.
Corrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Symington is anxious to marry ye,&rdquo; the woman
said in little more than a whisper.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Without
haste Kitty got up and moved to the door.&nbsp; Turning there,
she faced them both.&nbsp; Her voice was clear and
steady&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not marry Mr. Symington for&mdash;for twenty
thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man sprang to his feet, but she was gone, the door closed
behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almighty!&rdquo; he gasped, sinking back into his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong wi&rsquo; ye?&rdquo; cried his
sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;I warned ye she would never
consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll consent yet!&rdquo; he said, with a
suppressed oath.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;but what made her name
twenty thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>It was nearly an hour later when Colin reached his
father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Hayward Senior was not precisely a
heartless man, but he was totally without imagination.</p>
<p>Seated&mdash;one dares to say &ldquo;posed&rdquo;&mdash;at an
extremely orderly writing-table in his fine old library&mdash;he
received his youngest son with a stern look and motioned him to
be seated.&nbsp; He was in evening dress, and you would never
have taken him for anything but a gentleman&mdash;in the narrow
sense of the word.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;You are late,&rdquo; he said presently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walking about.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lovely
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hayward smiled bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you
alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colin looked at his
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I met Miss Carstairs, and we talked for a
little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who on earth is Miss Carstairs?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Hayward did not wait for an answer to his ironic question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mean the young woman in the local post-office, I
presume; the young woman, in fact, with whom your wretched
philanderings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, father!&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man
rose quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us leave Miss Carstairs out
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I trust you have informed her as to your income
and prospects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usual thing in the circumstances&mdash;is it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&nbsp; What
circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hayward, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you intend to marry the grocer&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;beg her
pardon&mdash;niece&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Colin
barely restrained the fury that paled his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
may take my word for it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Miss
Carstair&rsquo;s certainly does not intend to marry
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&nbsp; She must be a generous young person to
give her kisses for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an ugly silence.&nbsp; The son took a step forward,
his hands clenched at his sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since when,&rdquo; he asked at length, &ldquo;have you
been employing a private detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dull flush overran the older man&rsquo;s countenance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be careful!&nbsp; The information was not sought by
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to guess.&rdquo;&nbsp; He flicked a
folded note across the table.&nbsp; It was addressed in pencil to
&ldquo;T. H. Hayward, Esq.,&rdquo; marked &ldquo;Urgent,&rdquo;
had evidently been torn from a notebook, and had been sealed with
a scrap of stamp paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;The servant found it under
the hall door, about an hour ago.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all I can
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin opened it, and his face burned as he read&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend advises you that your youngest son and the
post-office girl were kissing in the wood to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hayward, &ldquo;do you know
the writing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His son made a gesture of negation.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I keep
this?&rdquo; he managed to say presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other, holding out his hand for the
paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will keep it&mdash;and God help the person
who wrote it, when I find him or her!&rdquo;&nbsp; Next moment he
resumed his cold manner and incisive tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;All that,
however, does not exonerate you, though I am not going to dwell
on the unsavoury subject of your disgrace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no disgrace!&rdquo; hotly cried Colin.</p>
<p>His father smiled wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Apparently we shall
not agree on the meaning of the word.&nbsp; Now may I ask: what
are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you, I am going to London,&rdquo; replied
Colin, holding himself in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hayward opened a drawer and
took out a small bundle of notes.&nbsp; He threw them on to the
table, saying, &ldquo;A hundred pounds.&nbsp; Do as you like, but
don&rsquo;t ask for more&mdash;for your own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; cried Colin, his anger lost in bitter
humiliation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I swear I did my best at college, only
I wasn&rsquo;t fitted for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;We have already discussed that.&nbsp; By the way,
I would suggest that you make it convenient to leave here early
in the morning instead of to-morrow night, and so spare, in some
measure, the feelings of your mother and
sisters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are heartless!&nbsp; I will leave the house
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please no, unless you desire to start a scandal among
the servants, and another in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are worse than heartless; you are unjust. . .
.&nbsp; But I will wait till the morning.&nbsp;
Good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colin turned and moved towards the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&nbsp; You have forgotten your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without looking back Colin went out.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hayward went to bed, half-an-hour later, he
left&mdash;deliberately&mdash;the notes lying on his
writing-table.</p>
<p>At 6.30 a.m. Colin entered a closed carriage, and with his
modest baggage was driven to the station.&nbsp; There had been no
farewells, and on the whole he did not regret their absence, for
he knew they would have been highly seasoned with reproaches and
unwelcome advice.&nbsp; He took a ticket for Glasgow.</p>
<p>Having heard the carriage drive away, Mr. Hayward in his
dressing gown came down to <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the library.&nbsp; Where the notes
had been he found a scrap of paper&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I.O.U.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">One hundred pounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">C. H. Hayward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He smiled sardonically, muttering, &ldquo;I thought he would
climb down,&rdquo; and put the I.O.U. beside the anonymous note
of last night, in his safe.</p>

25</span>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning mail for Dunford was
usually in the post-office by a quarter to seven.&nbsp; It was
conveyed from the train by Sam, the postman, a little stout
person with a grey military moustache, whose age, according to
his own statement, was &ldquo;forty-nine and a bit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It had been that for a good many years.&nbsp; With Sam&rsquo;s
assistance Kitty was wont to sort the letters, and the two had
become staunch friends, though no very serious confidences had
been exchanged.</p>
<p>In the midst of the sorting this morning Sam suddenly remarked
that Mr. Colin Hayward had not made a long stay with his
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen him at the station,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I couldna say where he was bound for, but he had a pickle
luggage, and he wasna looking extra cheery.&nbsp; Been getting
lectured for no passing his examination, I suppose.&nbsp; Poor
lad, I&rsquo;m vexed for him.&nbsp; He never got on with his
folk, and he&rsquo;s <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the only real gentleman in the
family.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re a cauld-hearted stuck-up lot.&nbsp;
Him an&rsquo; me used often to gang fishing&mdash;that was afore
your time, Miss&mdash;and a kinder, blither chap I never hope to
meet.&nbsp; Well, well, if he&rsquo;s the black sheep, the others
ha&rsquo; used a queer lot o&rsquo; whitewash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty felt that she was expected to say something, but just
then Sam came on an address that required deciphering, and the
subject dropped, not a little to her relief.</p>
<p>When the sorting was finished, Sam set out on his round, and
she made her way to the cottage for breakfast.&nbsp; Her uncle
was already at table looking more than usually morose; her aunt
was muttering to something on the stove&mdash;a habit of hers
when annoyed.&nbsp; Kitty perceived that she was still in
disgrace, and her heart sank.&nbsp; After all, those two people
constituted her whole kin, and she would have pleased them had it
been possible, if only for the sake of peace and
cheerfulness.&nbsp; More, she would have loved them had they
given her the slightest encouragement.</p>
<p>Mr. Corrie took no notice of his niece as she approached her
accustomed seat.&nbsp; To his sister he growled over his
shoulder&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper&rsquo;s late again!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a good
mind to start selling newspapers myself.&nbsp; That woman <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>seems to
think she can play wi&rsquo; her customers just because
she&rsquo;s a widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to her,&rdquo; said Miss Corrie,
coming over with a dish of bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her she had best bring the paper here&mdash;or
send it&mdash;within five minutes o&rsquo; the train&rsquo;s
arrival.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I hear ye, John.&nbsp; Take yer breakfast now, and
ha&rsquo; patience for the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meal was almost over when Mr. Corrie spoke
again&mdash;this time to his niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ha&rsquo; ye thought over what I said to ye last
night?&rdquo; he abruptly demanded.</p>
<p>Kitty was not unprepared for the question, and she answered
calmly enough that she had not further considered the
matter&mdash;which was not, perhaps, quite accurate&mdash;because
she had assumed that it was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ye&rsquo;d better think it over now, for Mr.
Symington&rsquo;s pretty sure to come again to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he comes, I can only tell him what I told
you&mdash;of course, I&rsquo;ll do it politely. . . .&nbsp; Uncle
John, why are you so anxious for me to marry that man?&nbsp; Tell
me straight&mdash;do you and Aunt Rachel want to get rid of
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie hesitated.&nbsp; He dared not say, as he was tempted to
say, that he could not afford to give <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>her a home any longer, because, for
one thing, the girl was as well aware as himself that he kept the
allowance made by the post-office for her services as
assistant&mdash;an assistant, by the way, who did practically all
the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so long ago you thought very little of Mr.
Symington,&rdquo; she pursued, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve often heard
Aunt Rachel call him anything but a nice man.&nbsp; Besides, he
must be nearly forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Corrie sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your aunt and me know him better than we used to.&nbsp; We
want you to marry him because we see &rsquo;twould be a good
thing for you.&nbsp; Same time, he&rsquo;s come into a heap of
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Miss Corrie, &ldquo;he has that!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s talking o&rsquo; giving up the farm and setting up
house in the city&mdash;Glasgow, maybe.&nbsp; That would suit ye
fine, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t do what you want,&rdquo;
the girl said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be dead than
married to him.&nbsp; He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk trash!&rdquo; exclaimed Corrie,
lowering upon her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll give him
&lsquo;ay&rsquo; to-night or it&rsquo;ll be the worse for
ye.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you try to cross me, ye daughter o&rsquo; a
beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; squealed his sister.</p>
<p>Kitty was on her feet, her beautiful eyes <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>blazing from
her white face.&nbsp; &ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; she cried,
shaking with furious indignation, &ldquo;how dare you speak so of
my father, a man with a great, noble mind?&mdash;you, you
miserable thing, with not an idea in your head, not a thought in
your heart, but money, money, money!&nbsp; My father owes you
nothing&mdash;nothing, do you hear?&nbsp; His daughter has earned
every penny she has cost you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Corrie, unused to contradiction, much less to
retaliation, rose, grey of countenance, shaking with
passion.&nbsp; Probably he was not aware that he had the bread
knife in his hand, but his sister grabbed his wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he began in a thick voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You are not sane,&rdquo; said
Kitty, &ldquo;or you would never have spoken such words about my
father, your own sister&rsquo;s husband&mdash;not that I&rsquo;ll
ever forgive them or you.&nbsp; But you are mad&mdash;mad with
greed!&nbsp; I tell you, once and for all, I&rsquo;m not for sale
to Mr. Symington!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down with a crash, his mouth gaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go!&rdquo; whispered Miss Corrie, motioning
frantically with her free hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s eight
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;time the office was open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty turned and went.&nbsp; She was glad to go, for her
courage was already burned out.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Miss
Corrie shook her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye fool, ye forsaken
fool!&rdquo; she sputtered.&nbsp; &ldquo;That temper o&rsquo;
yours has ruined everything.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll never get her to
marry him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned on her savagely.&nbsp; &ldquo;What ha&rsquo; ye told
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&nbsp; Never a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what did she mean by saying she wasna for sale? .
. .&nbsp; God! she must ha&rsquo; heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guessed maybe.&nbsp; Why did ye tell her the man had
come into a heap o&rsquo; money?&nbsp; I warned ye to go
canny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung her from him and got up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let her guess
what she likes, think what she likes, do what she likes&mdash;but
she&rsquo;s no going to beat me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll find a
way!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll manage her yet!&nbsp; Ten
thousand&mdash;twenty&mdash;maybe twenty-five thousand
pound&mdash;no, by heavens, I&rsquo;m not to be done out o&rsquo;
that by a stubborn lass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let be, John.&nbsp; Ye ha&rsquo; siller enough.&nbsp;
Ye dinna spend a trifle o&rsquo; your income.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll
rue the day that ye cheated your sister&rsquo;s daughter, for
that&rsquo;s what it comes to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your silly tongue, woman.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve cheated
nobody but myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, saying, &ldquo;I would like to read Hugh
Carstairs&rsquo; letter again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re welcome&mdash;another time.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the paper at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; He almost ran to
the front door.</p>
<p>He returned, opening the paper at the financial page.&nbsp;
Seating himself, he cleared a space on the table and laid it
thereon.&nbsp; Then his thick forefinger began to move down one
of the columns as though it was feeling for something.&nbsp; At
last it stopped, and he gazed awhile. . . .&nbsp; His breath went
in with a hiss.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zeniths!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>His sister was staring over his shoulder, but her sight was
indifferent.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she gasped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What about the Zeniths?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a hushed voice he replied, &ldquo;They rose
seven-and-sixpence yesterday.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re now worth
ninety shillings a share.&nbsp; That means &pound;22,500 for the
five thousand. . . .&nbsp; That would be &pound;11,260 for
me&mdash;us. . . .&nbsp; I wonder if Symington shouldna sell
now.&nbsp; Wait till I see if it says anything about them
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned to some paragraphs, headed
&ldquo;Mining Notes.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, here it
is!&nbsp; Oh, listen, Rachel!&nbsp; It says they&rsquo;ll likely
go to eight pound!&nbsp; Almighty!&nbsp; We munna let him
sell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time the shop was
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, so it is&mdash;but wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>With
another headshake she began to clear the table.</p>
<p>He rose suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the keys,&rdquo;
he said, throwing them on to the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye can open
the shop.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going up to White Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the risk of offending a stray
customer Kitty delayed opening the post-office until her outraged
spirit had become a little calmer&mdash;only a little, for the
mingled passions so brutally aroused would subside only through
sheer exhaustion.&nbsp; She had no one to confide in, no one to
count on for sympathy and comfort.&nbsp; She had thought she had
grown used to being alone in the world, but she had never
experienced loneliness like this.&nbsp; Her bosom heaved, but her
eyes remained dry.</p>
<p>The sounds of her aunt opening the shop next door roused her
from a sort of stupor.&nbsp; Taking the big key, she proceeded to
open the office for the day&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; There was
some book-keeping to be done, also a schedule or two to fill up,
but her hand shook so that she could scarcely write.&nbsp; And
suddenly she realized that she was afraid, desperately
afraid.&nbsp; She was so wholly <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>dependent on that man next door; her
very existence was in his hands; she was, to all intents and
purposes, his prisoner.</p>
<p>A few pounds would have made all the difference now.&nbsp; She
possessed less than two shillings.&nbsp; There was no escape.</p>
<p>She unlocked the safe, and transferred part of its contents,
money, stamps, and so forth, to their proper drawers.&nbsp; The
money gave her a sickish feeling; so much of it&mdash;the price
of her salvation over and over again&mdash;her freedom in a
fraction of it. . . .&nbsp; Violently she shut the drawer and
turned to the desk.</p>
<p>A child came in with a letter and a penny, and, a little
later, a woman with a parcel.&nbsp; Then there was a longish
blank till an elderly man entered.&nbsp; He made a brief remark
on the weather and proceeded to fill up a money order
request-form.&nbsp; Presently he pushed it across the counter
along with the money, &pound;27, in three five-pound and twelve
one-pound notes, also an eightpence to pay the charge.&nbsp;
Laying the money on the desk, she collected her wits and
carefully wrote out the order.&nbsp; Her sleeve brushed the notes
separate without her noticing.</p>
<p>The man wanted to know when a letter would be delivered in a
certain outlying place in Ireland, <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and she took the &ldquo;Post-office
guide&rdquo; to the counter and found him the information
contained therein.&nbsp; He went out, leaving the door
open.&nbsp; The brisk current of morning air was welcome.&nbsp;
Before she could turn from the counter a girl came in with a few
shillings for her savings account. . . .</p>
<p>When the girl had gone Kitty put her hands to her head, which
was now throbbing painfully.&nbsp; Some little time elapsed
before she returned to the desk.&nbsp; Observing the notes, she
gathered them up and placed them in the proper drawer for money
order and postal order transactions.&nbsp; She locked the drawer
with a key on the bunch hanging from her belt.&nbsp; Often this
drawer contained fairly large sums.&nbsp; Once more she attacked
her clerical work.</p>
<p>Somehow the morning passed.&nbsp; At noon she was relieved for
half an hour, by her uncle.&nbsp; He peered about, but made no
remark, and without even glancing at him she passed through the
short passage leading to the shop and thence to the
cottage.&nbsp; Her dinner was waiting on the table.&nbsp; Miss
Corrie, who had put it there, had gone back to the shop; she
dined with her brother later.</p>
<p>Kitty could not eat.&nbsp; After a while she went up to her
room and lay down for ten minutes.&nbsp; <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>The pity was
that she did not spend the whole of her half-hour upstairs.</p>
<p>The first thing Corrie did on being left to himself, was to
snatch from the floor, under the shadow of the desk, a five-pound
note.&nbsp; Holding it stretched between his hands, he stood
transfixed, while the clock ticked nearly a hundred
seconds.&nbsp; Then his hands began to shake and sweat appeared
on his face. . . .&nbsp; Two minutes later he left the office to
take care of itself, going out by the public way.&nbsp; Keeping
close to the wall he passed round behind the office and shop and
into the yard at the back of the house.&nbsp; The place was not
overlooked by neighbours, but he glanced keenly about him before
he turned his gaze upwards.&nbsp; Above the ivy an attic window
was wide open.</p>
<p>He tiptoed to an out-house; he tiptoed back with a
ladder.&nbsp; He placed the ladder in position and climbed a few
bars, halted, and made a show of doing something to the
ivy.&nbsp; Ascending further, he repeated the performance.&nbsp;
At last he was at the window.&nbsp; For a few seconds he remained
with his body bent and stretched into the room, then he withdrew,
descended the ladder, replaced it in the out-house, and returned
to the office.</p>
<p>At 12.30 his niece appeared.&nbsp; He moved towards <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>the shop,
seemed to change his mind, and came back.&nbsp; He cleared his
throat, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check the cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitherto the formality had always taken place after business
hours, but the girl, too sick at heart to be surprised at
anything, without hesitation or remark handed him her keys.</p>
<p>Before long Miss Corrie called him to dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to wait,&rdquo; he returned,
apparently immersed in his task.</p>
<p>At the end of twenty minutes he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; she asked
wearily.</p>
<p>He pointed to the open drawer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re
short!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; Twenty-seven pounds&mdash;that&rsquo;s
been the only money order business to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s only twenty-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a mistake,&rdquo; she said, with
reviving alertness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three fives and twelve
singles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that how Torrance gave ye the money?&nbsp; Be very
sure now!&mdash;Three fives and twelve singles?&nbsp;
Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly sure,&rdquo; she returned
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;The notes must have stuck.&nbsp; How
much do you make me short?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>&ldquo;Count for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took them out and laid them on the counter.&nbsp; There
was a short silence broken only by the rustle of the paper and
the ticking of the clock.</p>
<p>Suddenly she raised her head and looked him straight in the
eyes, without a word.</p>
<p>He stood her gaze for a brief space, then turned it to the
notes.&nbsp; His fist banged the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five pound short&mdash;a five-pound note&mdash;where is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still she stared at him silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can ye no answer?&rdquo; he snarled at last.</p>
<p>She answered with an odd, slow smile.&nbsp; It maddened
him.&nbsp; He strode across to the passage and shouted for his
sister.</p>
<p>Miss Corrie came at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter, John?&nbsp; Mind, the lad&rsquo;s in the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him to his dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp; I want a
witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A witness!&rdquo; screeched the woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie pushed her aside, and bawled&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, ye can go for your dinner now.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
waited until he heard a door open and close, then wheeled and
said to his sister&mdash;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s five pound
short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Corrie threw up her hands.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kitty quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
five pounds short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was about to speak, but her brother motioned her to
hold her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know where that five-pound note is. . .
.&nbsp; Do ye hear me, girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paid not the slightest attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Rachel,&rdquo; he said, somewhat wildly,
&ldquo;she admits she got twenty-seven pound from Torrance this
morning.&nbsp; She had the key o&rsquo; the drawer all the time I
was here my lone.&nbsp; As you and the boy can swear I never
passed to the house.&nbsp; When I checked the cash in her
presence, I found her five pound short. . . .&nbsp; And she
won&rsquo;t say what&rsquo;s become o&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; cried Miss Corrie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; said the girl, and there
was a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were ye up the stair at your dinner-time?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; I heard her,&rdquo; said her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s my duty to&mdash;to make a
search,&rdquo; he said in a thick voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the police,&rdquo; said Kitty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He all but lost control then.&nbsp; &ldquo;Up to your <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>room!&rdquo;
he roared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rachel, you maun come
likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty turned and led the way.&nbsp; She felt that this was
only the beginning of the ghastly farce, nothing could possibly
be found in her room unless her uncle contrived to put it there
while he was pretending to search, and she would see to it that
he was not allowed to manage that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s no in there,&rdquo; said Corrie, as they
reached the small landing, &ldquo;your aunt&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to
search your person.&nbsp; Go inside the two o&rsquo; ye.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll bide here.&nbsp; Rachel, you make search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty began to feel puzzled in a dull, dreary fashion.&nbsp;
Her uncle could play no tricks from where he stood.&nbsp; Why
should he make such a long business of the matter?&nbsp; He had
failed to terrify her, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll I search?&rdquo; wailed Miss Corrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every place.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s got to be found,&rdquo;
replied her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Government
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take a long, long time.&nbsp; Would ye no
give her another chance to&mdash;to speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s had her chance.&nbsp; Hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no doubt natural that Miss Corrie should start with the
chest of drawers that served also for a dressing table, placed at
an angle with the <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>window and near it.&nbsp; She drew out the right-hand
top drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn it out on the floor,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>Kitty sat down on the bed and apathetically watched the
scattering of her poor little fineries, gloves, ribbons, fancy
buttons, and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; there, anyway,&rdquo; remarked
Rachel, rising at last.</p>
<p>She opened the neighbour drawer, and Kitty winced, for it held
her father&rsquo;s manuscripts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Rachel, and stood petrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; called her brother, and she
started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; she whispered, and
held it up.</p>
<p>Corrie strode in, snatched it and held it close to his
niece&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Kitty was white as death now.&nbsp; What dumb innocence, what
loud defence, could stand against this?</p>
<p>Her aunt slunk from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Corrie at last in a lowered voice,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let ye go free now; I&rsquo;ll let ye go free
till this time to-morrow&mdash;no, till ten o&rsquo;clock
to-morrow night.&nbsp; But if ye want to go free after that, ye
know the way&mdash;the only way.&nbsp; Now ye can think over
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll mind the office myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he went out.</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Had
Kitty held a weapon of any sort then, she would certainly have
tried to kill him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>In the evening her aunt brought her some tea, set it down, and
retired without a word.&nbsp; But no restraint was put on her
movements.&nbsp; Restraint was unnecessary.&nbsp; Where could she
go, penniless?&nbsp; Later, when she heard Symington&rsquo;s
voice in the kitchen, she stole downstairs and out of doors.</p>
<p>In the dusk, an hour afterwards, she stood at her old place,
waiting the roaring approach, the thundering dash past, of the
London mail.&nbsp; Colin Hayward would not be on board, she told
herself, and wondered vaguely why, after all, he had left early
in the morning.&nbsp; And now he would be in London, and things
there would already be making him forget her.&nbsp; She did not
love him as she judged a maid should love a man&mdash;but oh! how
gladly she would have yielded now to his tender arms and his kind
voice. . . .</p>
<p>The train was coming&mdash;it was nearly on her.&nbsp;
Something white fluttered from a window.&nbsp; But the signal
could not be for her!&mdash;and yet with her heart in her eyes
she gazed.&nbsp; And just for a tick of time she had a glimpse of
Colin&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; It was all over.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>She
laid her arms on the fence, and bowed her face on them, and wept
as never she had wept in all her one-and-twenty years&mdash;such
tears of bitterness, such tears of loneliness.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sam, quitting his post on the railway, may have
wondered at the bowed figure, but he went off discreetly by his
one way, a hundred yards further down the field.</p>
<p>In the starry darkness Kitty came to herself, and slowly made
her way to the only home she had.&nbsp; Emotion had weakened her
physically, but her spirit yet struggled strongly in the
toils.&nbsp; She had still nearly twenty-four hours of freedom,
such as it was.&nbsp; To-night it was too late for any
persecution from Alec Symington, who surely must have left the
cottage some time ago, and gone home, for it was now nearing
eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>But on the road, at the gate of the field, he was waiting.</p>
<h2><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Aren&rsquo;t</span> you going to
shake hands?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; He was leaning on the gate,
smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>It was not so dark that the girl, who had halted a couple of
yards away, could fail to see the smile accompanying the
words.&nbsp; Symington&rsquo;s was by no means an ill-looking
countenance, though forty years, half of them strenuous after a
fashion, had blurred the fineness of the well-shaped features; it
would have been attractive, admirable even, but for something in
the eyes, something about the mouth, under the nicely trimmed
tawny moustache, that is not to be fully described by the word
covetous.&nbsp; His was a face that no wise man would regard
without doubts, that no wise woman would trust.&nbsp; Symington
was tall and broad-shouldered, but in the light of day he had a
softish look, and one imagined him as a &ldquo;fat man&rdquo; in
the years soon to come.&nbsp; He was no hard-working
farmer.&nbsp; White Farm had come <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>to him for lack of a worthier and
fitter heir, his two brothers having died not long before his
father, and there were honest people in the neighbourhood who
would tell you that the good old property was already on the road
to ruin.&nbsp; Symington&rsquo;s record was that of a man who had
seen a good deal of life in different parts of the world, and
learned little worth knowing, who had frequently touched the
skirts of Fortune but never captured her, and who had gambled
away more hours than he had toiled.&nbsp; And now, at forty, he
was probably nearer to Fortune than he had ever been, and
certainly nearer to love, as he understood it.&nbsp; For in Kitty
Carstairs he had nothing to gain but youthful sweetness and fresh
beauty; indeed, in a material sense, the possession of her was
going to cost him dear&mdash;if he kept his bond with the
contemptible John Corrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to shake hands?&rdquo; he asked
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please open the gate,&rdquo; said Kitty, &ldquo;or I
must go home another way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely night, and your aunt knows
I&rsquo;m looking after you.&nbsp; I want to have a talk with
you, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very tired&mdash;too tired
to listen to any one.&nbsp; Please let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you long, and we can find a
nice dry seat in the wood, since you&rsquo;re so tired.&nbsp;
Come, you needn&rsquo;t be shy with me, Kitty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to open the gate?&rdquo; she coldly
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately, if you&rsquo;ll promise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned sharply.&nbsp; Some one had come out of the little
wood, and was crossing the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam!&rdquo; cried the girl in a gasp of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can ye no&rsquo; get the gate open?&rdquo; the postman
inquired, as though no Symington had been there.&nbsp; He came
forward and laid a hand on the bolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the blazes do you want?&rdquo; blurted Symington,
suddenly erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking Miss Carstairs is due home by
now,&rdquo; Sam said coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do ye say,
Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carstairs is in my charge, you interfering
fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Sam; I&rsquo;m not!&mdash;and I want to get
home at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly stand aside, Mr. Symington,&rdquo; said the
postman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand aside&mdash;for you!&rdquo; exclaimed Symington
in a fury.&nbsp; With an ugly laugh and a curse he drove his fist
at the little man&rsquo;s face, sending <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>him down in a
heap.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s to go on with,&rdquo; he said,
and strolled off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you coward!&rdquo; cried Kitty, wrenching open the
gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you badly hurt, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam was already rising, holding his aching jaw.&nbsp; Inwardly
he was raging, but all he said then was, &ldquo;All right,
Miss.&nbsp; My turn&rsquo;ll maybe come.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll
be seeing ye home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught his arm, for he seemed in need of support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re trembling, Miss,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;and no wonder.&nbsp; Never mind; it&rsquo;s all over
now.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d just like to hear ye say ye didna think
me too interfering-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what I&rsquo;d have done if you hadn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be grateful to you as long as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a reward to hear that ye
didna want his company, for he&rsquo;s a rotten bad
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked a little way in silence, and then a sob escaped
the girl.&nbsp; She was at the end of her wits and her
courage.&nbsp; Few of us can struggle alone all the time, and she
knew that Sam had saved her only for a matter of so many
hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, cheer up, Miss,&rdquo; he said kindly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye wasna in the office to-night, and your aunt told <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>me ye wasna
so well, so it&rsquo;s no wonder ye&rsquo;re upset.&nbsp;
Still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
tell you everything&mdash;nearly everything.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
the only soul I can trust.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in whispered,
spasmodic sentences she poured forth her tale.</p>
<p>Sam was more than shocked; he was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of it, to think of it!&rdquo; he repeated
feebly a dozen times before wrath and pity took command of his
honest soul.&nbsp; Then he was for taking John Corrie by the
throat, and shaking all but the last breath out of his body, for
telling Miss Corrie exactly what he thought of her, and for
presenting Kitty with his savings, yea, and his own little abode,
to enable her to stand independent of her unnatural
relatives.</p>
<p>She was half-laughing, half-crying, by the time he paused for
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam, you know I&rsquo;d never allow you to do any
of those things for my sake, but I&rsquo;ll never forget your
goodness.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t do anything, or I&rsquo;ll wish
I hadn&rsquo;t told you.&nbsp; But I do want you to advise me
what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never liked John Corrie,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;nor
did any soul in Dunford; but I never doubted he was a straight
man.&nbsp; But dinna ye be afraid <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>for the five-pun&rsquo; note
business&mdash;dinna ye be afraid for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what I am afraid of!&nbsp; I might
escape from Mr. Symington by simply going away, but not
from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle would never dare to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare?&nbsp; After what he&rsquo;s done, what would he
not dare?&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s clever in his way.&nbsp; How did
he get that five-pound note into my drawer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s hand went to his mouth.&nbsp; A sound not unlike a
chuckle became the beginning of a fit of coughing.&nbsp; When it
had passed he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll maybe find that out yet, so dinna let it
bother ye too much, Miss.&nbsp; But if he tries to frighten ye,
let me know, and I&rsquo;ll deal wi&rsquo; him&mdash;by gravy,
I&rsquo;ll deal wi&rsquo; him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, you must be careful.&nbsp; What if he got you into
trouble, and you lost your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can take care o&rsquo; myself,&rdquo; said Sam,
&ldquo;except, maybe at the boxing&mdash;and I didna get fair
play from that scoundrel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He laughed ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, as I said, my turn&rsquo;ll maybe
come&mdash;and yours&rsquo;ll come to a certainty, Miss.&nbsp;
Keep up your heart.&nbsp; Are ye feeling a bit better
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she answered warmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so awful when one isn&rsquo;t all
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, pretty thing!&rdquo; he said gently,
&ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll win through yet. . . .&nbsp; And now
we&rsquo;re nearly there, and I&rsquo;d best no be seen wi&rsquo;
ye.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll get a talk at sorting-time in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m forbidden the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your uncle does that, we&rsquo;ll just ha&rsquo; to
find another way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a hurried pat on her shoulder, he turned and went.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>The cottage door was not locked.&nbsp; Having entered, Kitty
stood still for a moment, listening.&nbsp; Silence.&nbsp; She
turned into the kitchen to find it, as she had scarcely dared to
hope, unoccupied.&nbsp; Her aunt and uncle had evidently retired
for the night.&nbsp; A candle burned on the table.&nbsp; A jug of
milk, bread and butter were there also.&nbsp; Somehow the sight
of food stirred her sense of humour.&nbsp; She had read of a
murderer being treated to an egg with his breakfast on the
morning of his execution, and it had struck her as pathetically
absurd.&nbsp; Never before had such an attention been paid
her.&nbsp; She drank a little milk, because she was thirsty, and
went upstairs.</p>
<p>On the chest of drawers in her room she found <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>a piece of
yellow wrapping paper bearing her aunt&rsquo;s writing in
pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your work in the office to-morrow morning as
usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So her uncle intended to keep his promise that she should
&ldquo;go free&rdquo; until the following night.&nbsp; But after
that, what?</p>
<p>If Kitty had disliked Symington in the past, she hated him,
nay, detested him now.&nbsp; Yes, and despised him.&nbsp; His
assault on Sam had brought about the last.&nbsp; To give
Symington his due, he had regretted the blow almost at
once.&nbsp; It had been a stupid blunder to make in Kitty&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; Her indignant, contemptuous words had told him
that.</p>
<p>He had gone home angry with himself, cursing the postman,
feeling that it would be inadvisable, if not fatal, to approach
the girl again until the thing had cooled in her mind.&nbsp; Then
he could apologize, blaming the outburst on his overpowering
desire for her.&nbsp; Yes, he had better give her a week, during
which Old Corrie would, of course, continue to exert his
influence.&nbsp; Meantime he would make a trip to London.&nbsp;
Whether he liked it or not, he must convert a few Zeniths into
cash.</p>
<p>Kitty endured a bad two hours before sleep <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>came, but
nature won at last, and she passed the remainder of the night in
blessed unconsciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>With the morning mail-bags Sam arrived in a heated condition,
puffing and blowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in such a hurry to see how ye was, Miss,&rdquo;
he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keeping up your heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a nod and a brave smile.&nbsp; Poor old Sam! he
was good and kind and willing, but how could he really help her
from her hideous plight?</p>
<p>They fell to work on the contents of the sacks, and the
minutes ticked past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Registered letter, Miss,&rdquo; said Sam, throwing it
to her end of the counter, as he usually did with such a
packet.</p>
<p>She was about to lay it aside for attention later when the
address caught her eye.&nbsp; A cry escaped her.</p>
<p>Sam turned to see her, white as a ghost, tearing at the
envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what can it be?&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; Then,
as if courage failed her, &ldquo;Sam, come and take it.&nbsp;
Tell me what it&rsquo;s all about.&nbsp; I&mdash;I daren&rsquo;t
look.&nbsp; It may be nothing much, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s fingers were none too steady as he received the
envelope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Registered at Glasgow,&rdquo; <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>he muttered,
and proceeded to extract the contents.</p>
<p>These were a fairly plump number of banknotes, and a
half-sheet of paper bearing the words&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From an old friend of your father.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp;
Sam read them aloud while she stood rigid with her face in her
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to count them?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five-pun&rsquo; notes,&rdquo; he said, and there
followed a rustling pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twenty o&rsquo;
them&mdash;a hundred pound. . . .&nbsp; See!&rdquo; he took one
of her hands from her face, and pressed the bundle into it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Feel them&mdash;they&rsquo;re real, ye poor, pretty
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sam</span> was doomed to be late in
starting on his round that morning.&nbsp; The moment
Kitty&rsquo;s mind grasped the significance of the windfall her
tongue was loosed.&nbsp; She talked excitedly, even wildly.&nbsp;
The sender of the notes&mdash;she wished he had given his
name&mdash;must be some one whom her father had helped in the old
days.&nbsp; Her father was always lending money that never came
back.&nbsp; That was why there was none when he died.&nbsp; She
hoped she might some day discover the sender, otherwise he could
never realize how much more than kind, how truly wonderful, was
the thing he had done.&nbsp; For he had given a desperate,
persecuted girl her freedom!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are ye going to do, Miss?&rdquo; Sam ventured
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to trust you,&rdquo; she said, with a
broken laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, surely ye can do that.&nbsp; But I hope
ye&rsquo;re <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>no&rsquo; for being reckless.&nbsp; Your eyes are
shining something terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed again, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
London!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;London!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took Sam some moments to recover.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what&rsquo;s taking ye a&rsquo; the road to London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always
said I would go if I had the money&mdash;and now I&rsquo;ve got
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha&rsquo; ye friends in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this&rsquo;ll never do!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll happen to ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ll have some adventures&mdash;I hope
so&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adventures, guid God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And I may make my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw up his hands muttering, &ldquo;Oh, dear! the money
has turned her head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid her hand on his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want you to help
me,&rdquo; she said softly; &ldquo;that is, if you can do it
without getting yourself into trouble.&nbsp; The express stops at
Kenny Junction at five minutes to nine, but that&rsquo;s six
miles away, and I must take some luggage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how can
ye think it out so quick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought it out, and dreamed of it, and cried
about it, Sam, oh, a hundred times!&nbsp; Now, can you get some
one with a cart, or anything on wheels, to meet me, secretly,
outside of the village, at seven o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her a long look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will ye no&rsquo; think
over it, Miss?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to-night.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you imagine
what life here, with those people, must be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;No&rsquo; to
be endured, I dare say.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;&mdash;he became
timid&mdash;&ldquo;I mun ask ye a question, Miss, whether it
offends ye or no.&nbsp; It&mdash;it&rsquo;s about young Mr.
Hayward.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; running away wi&rsquo; him,
are ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had forgotten all about
him,&rdquo; she said truthfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a question to
ask!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she flushed a little.</p>
<p>He looked abashed as he murmured&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young folks do stupid things in haste, and it was for
both your sakes I asked the question.&nbsp; Well, well,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;if your mind&rsquo;s made up, I suppose I canna
change it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll see about a cart, Sam?&rdquo; she said
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>&ldquo;What? . . . why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because when ye leave your uncle&rsquo;s house, when ye
leave Dunford, ye mun leave wi&rsquo; your head high and your
name fair.&nbsp; Think, Miss!&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll it mean if ye
creep away as if&mdash;as if ye was guilty?&nbsp; Why, it would
mean that your uncle would be free to make a scandal, aye, and
maybe do something worse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he can prove me guilty as it is!&nbsp; And do you
think for a moment he would let me go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ye trust me, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; if you won&rsquo;t keep me from going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ye&rsquo;ve promised!&nbsp; Now listen, for
we&rsquo;ll maybe no&rsquo; get another chance to arrange
it.&nbsp; At seven o&rsquo;clock to-night ye&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;
your bag and things ready, and ye&rsquo;ll come down the stair,
wi&rsquo; neither fear nor trembling, and ye&rsquo;ll open the
door, and ye&rsquo;ll find me waiting wi&rsquo; a
cart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sam, Sam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if your uncle or your aunt asks where ye&rsquo;re
going, answer the truth.&nbsp; But if they try to stop ye, leave
them to me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; If ye canna trust
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I will&mdash;I do!&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled, and I just hope
I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; doing a bad thing for ye in helping ye. . .
.&nbsp; And now the folk&rsquo;ll be wondering what&rsquo;s come
over their letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty was not sorry to discover that she had only five minutes
left for breakfast.&nbsp; She was all apprehension lest her
nerves or her looks should betray her.&nbsp; The slightest
appearance of cheerfulness, she felt, would alone be fatal.&nbsp;
Fortunately, her uncle had left the table, and was immersed in
the morning paper at the fireside.&nbsp; Zeniths had fallen half
a crown, and it seemed to him the beginning of the end.&nbsp; His
niece&rsquo;s engagement to Symington twelve hours hence would
not take place a moment too soon.&nbsp; He never doubted that the
girl would give in.</p>
<p>Miss Corrie, silent, her face a melancholy mask, was beginning
to tidy up things.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken during the girl&rsquo;s brief stay at
the table, but when she rose to go to open the office her uncle
spoke from behind the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll mind what I told ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without response she made for the door.&nbsp; And just then
her mind was suddenly confronted with a new difficulty.&nbsp; She
was expected to be on duty in the post office until 8 p.m. . . .
and yet she must have her things packed and be ready for <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Sam an hour
earlier.&nbsp; At the door she turned, feeling it was now or
never.&nbsp; In a voice that shook naturally enough she
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can stop in the office till eight
to-night.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence full of acute suspense, until he returned
grudgingly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Your aunt can take charge after
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried away, her heart thumping with relief.&nbsp; She
would have nearly an hour and a half to herself before the hour
of departure.&nbsp; Heaven help her to keep her self-control till
then.&nbsp; She told herself she did not doubt Sam, and yet . .
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said Miss Corrie, &ldquo;do ye think
she&rsquo;ll give in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She darena face the other thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause&mdash;&ldquo;John, what do ye think she wanted
the five-pun&rsquo; note for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might ha&rsquo; got a safer place to hide it than
she did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ye hold your silly tongue, woman!&nbsp; Zeniths
went down two-and-six yesterday.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going up to
White Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Eleven hours later Kitty stood in her room <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>ready to
go.&nbsp; It was seven o&rsquo;clock, but she was allowing a
minute or two to pass in order to make sure of Sam&rsquo;s being
there.&nbsp; Her courage was at ebb, and she was very pale.&nbsp;
Yet she hoped she might escape from the house without being
noticed.&nbsp; The best of her worldly goods were contained in a
bag and hold-all, part of her luggage of five years ago.</p>
<p>At last she felt she must go or faint.&nbsp; She opened the
door softly and picked up her burdens.&nbsp; The bag was
heavy.&nbsp; She was taking her father&rsquo;s manuscripts.&nbsp;
Stealthily she stepped across the small landing, and began to
descend.&nbsp; But it was impossible to move, laden as she was,
on that narrow, wooden stair without making considerable
noise.&nbsp; And as she reached the bottom she was confronted by
her uncle, who had just shut the shop for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he demanded with an awful
frown, as he blocked the way to the front door.</p>
<p>Kitty&rsquo;s heart all but failed her.&nbsp; She cleared her
throat, wet her lips, and managed to utter the words&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the man was stupefied.&nbsp; Then his shout went
down the passage leading to shop and post office&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;Rachel!&mdash;here, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In desperation Kitty sought to push past.&nbsp; He seized her
arm.&nbsp; He was breathing hard; his face was the colour of
putty.</p>
<p>Miss Corrie appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, perceiving
the luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; said her brother thickly,
&ldquo;says she going to London.&nbsp; Liker to jail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can she go to London or any place?&rdquo; cried the
woman, &ldquo;unless&mdash;did ye check the cash,
John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Rachel!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her luggage up the stair, Rachel,&rdquo; Corrie
ordered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to do
something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was opened from the outside.&nbsp; Sam stood on the
step.&nbsp; Beyond him, at the gate of the little garden, was a
pony cart he had borrowed or hired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye ready, Miss?&rdquo; said Sam, cheerfully.</p>
<p>Corrie strode to the door, his face working with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the &mdash; do ye mean?&rdquo; he demanded
threateningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carstairs,&rdquo; said Sam, without flinching,
&ldquo;is for London, and it&rsquo;s my pleasure to drive her to
the junction.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad, too,&rdquo; screamed Miss
Corrie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shut the door in his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swiftly Sam stepped inside, and closed the door,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corrie,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;I would
advise ye no&rsquo; to interfere.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
Kitty&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your luggage, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie, beside himself, raised his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said the other, still calmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The folk in Dunford are maybe dull, but I could tell them
a thing, Mr. Corrie, that would make them spit on ye in the
street, and maybe pull your house and shop about your ears. . .
.&nbsp; Come, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move a step, and I send for the policeman,&rdquo;
roared Corrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case,&rdquo; retorted the postman,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just ha&rsquo; to give ye in charge.&nbsp; For
what, I ask ye, was ye doin&rsquo; up the ladder yesterday, about
12.30 p.m.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, postman.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; ye a straight question.&nbsp; I
was comin&rsquo; down the hill at the time, but I&rsquo;ve guid
sight still, and what&rsquo;s more I had a witness.&nbsp; Ye can
say ye was paying attention to yer ivy&mdash;an&rsquo; truth it
needs it!&mdash;but in that case, I would ask ye if the ivy was
growing inside o&rsquo; this young lady&rsquo;s bedroom. . .
.&nbsp; Come, Miss.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; touch
ye.&rdquo;&nbsp; And opening the door, and then <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>gently
pushing Corrie out of the way, he took possession of the bag and
hold-all.</p>
<p>And he and the girl passed out without hindrance.</p>
<p>When they had gone the woman turned a ghastly face on her
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, ye mun tell me what he meant about the
ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if he had not heard, Corrie staggered out of the house and
took the road to White Farm.</p>
<p>Sam put his charge into the express with many injunctions and
a package of sweets.&nbsp; Kitty had scarcely spoken during the
drive, and now speech failed her altogether.&nbsp; She could only
cling to his rough hand, and nod her promises to send her
address, when she found one, and let him know if ever she
required help.&nbsp; He was a lonely man, and she had given him a
new and great interest in life.</p>
<p>They were too much engrossed at the last minute to notice a
high-wheeled gig dash up to the station gate and deposit a
passenger who entered the train lower down just as it was
starting.</p>
<p>There were three other passengers in the compartment, all more
or less inclined to doze.&nbsp; Though deadly tired, Kitty had no
inclination for sleep.&nbsp; Nor could she give a thought to the
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>future.&nbsp; Not so soon could her mind and nerves
recover from the strain and shock of the last two days.</p>
<p>After Carlisle, however, she found herself alone, and the
solitude began to have a soothing effect.&nbsp; She lay back in
her corner and closed her eyes.&nbsp; The great train&mdash;the
dear, kind monster she had so often watched and longed to travel
on&mdash;thundered out its miles southward, and at two in the
morning slumber was not far from the exhausted girl.</p>
<p>Kitty gave a little sigh of content&mdash;and opened her
eyes.</p>
<p>The door of the compartment slid back.&nbsp; Alec Symington
entered.</p>
<h2><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment or two Kitty was
terror-stricken.</p>
<p>Then common sense came to her aid.&nbsp; She was free, she was
independent: the man might annoy her with his attentions, but he
could not harm her.&nbsp; She sat up and met his smile with a
grave look of inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pleasant surprise, Kitty,&rdquo; he said,
seating himself directly opposite.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather a crowd in
my part of the train, and I was hunting for a compartment with
room to spare when fortune led me here,&rdquo; he lied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not often I&rsquo;m so lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty made no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have let me know you were going to make a
journey,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, &ldquo;but perhaps you
decided on it since I saw you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He glanced at her
things on the rack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see you are going all the
way.&nbsp; Well, so much the better for me&mdash;eh?&nbsp; Come,
Kitty, be friendly and say something.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, Mr. Symington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of last night&mdash;or, to be
correct, the night before last.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m glad of
this chance of apologizing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry I struck the
postman, but I was mad with the man for interfering, you
know.&nbsp; I had something to tell you, Kitty, something
I&rsquo;ve wanted to tell you for a long time. . . .&nbsp; Well,
are you going to forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better ask Sam that.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t
hurt me&mdash;you only disgusted me.&nbsp; I think you should try
to find a seat in another compartment.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was quite
cool now.&nbsp; Indeed, she was not sorry to have the opportunity
of humiliating him for Sam&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>At her words his face took on a dusky shade, but he asked
quietly enough, &ldquo;Is that quite fair, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to my name.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had she
owned a book then she would have opened it.&nbsp; She turned to
the window, let up the blind, and sought to ignore him by peering
out into the darkness; but if she thought thus to get rid of his
company, or even silence him, she was mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very foolish little girl,&rdquo; he said
presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here you are, running away to London,
where you haven&rsquo;t a friend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; she demanded, turning
on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was true.&nbsp; She had suddenly
remembered that Colin was there, not that she expected ever to
meet him.&nbsp; But the inspiration served her purpose: Symington
was taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is some one your uncle does not know of,&rdquo;
he said sharply, and wished he had not spoken, for she was quick
to retort&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my uncle told you I was in the train, though you
pretended to be surprised to see me!&nbsp; I may be foolish, Mr.
Symington, but I&rsquo;m not utterly stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;delightfully stupid,&rdquo; he returned,
restraining his temper, &ldquo;if you think I&rsquo;m going to
let you disappear into London before I have seen what your friend
is like.&nbsp; London is a dangerous place, as you would know if
you had ever shown your pretty face in it before.&nbsp; Now
don&rsquo;t get excited.&nbsp; Be reasonable&mdash;patient, if
you like to call it that.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wonder at your
running away from your awful relations and that dead-alive
village, but what are you going to do in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty, now both angry and uneasy, did not reply.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be impertinent,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help being aware that you have
no money&mdash;or, at least, very little.&nbsp; Now in
London&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t concern yourself whether I have money
or not,&rdquo; she interrupted hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will force
me to leave this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&mdash;just a moment.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help
concerning myself&mdash;no man could&mdash;in the
circumstances.&nbsp; And as I happen to be a man who is in love
with you&mdash;oh, you know it very well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose to take her things from the rack.&nbsp; It was
certainly not a wise move.&nbsp; With a strange laugh he sprang
up and caught her, prisoning her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly little girl,&rdquo; he whispered passionately,
&ldquo;to think you can be quit of me so easily!&nbsp; No,
no!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got you and I mean to keep you.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t struggle&mdash;it&rsquo;s no use.&nbsp; There!&rdquo;
he had her fast.&nbsp; They swayed a little with the movement of
the train.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now listen, Kitty,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll like me better when you know me better.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not a bad sort, and I can give you things you&rsquo;ve
never dreamed of.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s be friends for the
present.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t hurry you about the other
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice sounded a little breathless.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In a few hours we&rsquo;ll be in London.&nbsp; <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>If your
friend is there, good and well; but if not, you must let me look
after you&mdash;show you where to stay, and so on.&nbsp; Leave
everything to me.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have a jolly good time while
you&rsquo;re getting to know me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrenching one of her hands free she struck him in the
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless the word stung more than the blow.&nbsp; A madness
grew in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heavens, I&rsquo;ll kiss you for that!&rdquo; he
cried&mdash;and let her go with a stifled curse.&nbsp; The girl
sank into her corner, ruddy.&nbsp; The man sat down, ghastly.</p>
<p>The corridor door was drawn back by a young woman in rather
fashionable attire.&nbsp; In her left hand she had a
&ldquo;sevenpenny,&rdquo; a finger marking the place.&nbsp;
Without a glance at either occupant she stepped in and, leaving
the door open, seated herself and began to read.</p>
<p>Kitty had again turned her face to the window, and soon the
shameful glow faded, leaving her pale.&nbsp; The natural reaction
came, and she wanted to cry.&nbsp; Symington&rsquo;s colour, on
the other hand, had risen.&nbsp; Once more he sat opposite,
looking hot and sulky.&nbsp; After a little while he produced his
cigarette case, but he put it back unopened.&nbsp; <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>He would have
given something for a newspaper though it had been a week
old.&nbsp; He was furious with the intruder, and now and then
took a stealthy glance at her which might possibly have alarmed
her had she observed it.&nbsp; Now and then, also, he took such a
glance at Kitty, and at last discovered that she was on the verge
of tears.&nbsp; Confound it! she must not be allowed to make a
scene.&nbsp; He transferred himself to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Kitty, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he
whispered, and surreptitiously put his hand on her elbow.</p>
<p>She started as if from pollution.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
leave me alone?&rdquo; she said under her breath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never want to see you again, but I&rsquo;ll
hate you a little less, perhaps, if you go back to the
compartment you came from&mdash;anywhere out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nettled, he replied, &ldquo;You may as well make up your mind
that I&rsquo;m going to see you start safe in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew away from him as far as possible and resumed her
study of the darkness.</p>
<p>Symington, trying to look as if he had not been rebuffed, lay
back, folded his arms and stared openly, rather rudely at the
intruder, who was now making a pencil jotting on the fly-leaf of
her <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>book.&nbsp; When she had finished writing she went back
to the printed page, read for a few moments, and stopped as if an
idea had struck her.&nbsp; She put up her hand and pressed the
button labelled &ldquo;Attendant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she returned
to the story.</p>
<p>It was beginning to dawn on Symington that she was not a bad
looking girl, though she must be a pure idiot, when a steward
from the sleeping-car appeared in the doorway.&nbsp; The man
saluted the girl respectfully, and as though he were pleased to
see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know you were travelling with us to-night,
Miss,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>She smiled upon him, and tearing out the fly-leaf, folded and
handed it to him with a look which apparently he
understood.&nbsp; He bowed and retired.</p>
<p>Symington had got the length of admitting to himself that in
other circumstances she might have made a pleasant enough
travelling companion, when the official again appeared.&nbsp; Not
a little to Symington&rsquo;s surprise it was himself who the man
now addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; came the polite English speech,
&ldquo;but I can find you a comfortable seat in another part of
the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>After a
slight pause&mdash;&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Symington shortly,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m pretty well where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry sir, but this compartment is reserved for ladies
only,&rdquo; said the other, politely as before, and proceeded to
affix to the window a label bearing out his statement.</p>
<p>Symington hesitated, but he had the wit to realize that there
was nothing for it but to go.&nbsp; Bluster would only make him
ridiculous.&nbsp; With what dignity he could command he said to
Kitty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you when we arrive,&rdquo; favoured
the intruder with a scowl which ought to have slain her, but
which nearly made her smile, and followed the official.</p>
<p>And Kitty began to sob helplessly, her face in her
handkerchief.</p>
<p>At the end of, perhaps, a couple of minutes she felt a light
touch on her shoulder, and was aware that the intruder was
sitting down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you cry any longer,&rdquo; said a calm low-pitched
voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be thinking I did the wrong thing in
interfering.&nbsp; Besides, the attendant will be here
immediately with some tea for us, and he might think he had done
the wrong thing, too.&nbsp; Also, you have nothing to cry about
now&mdash;have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Kitty, wiping her eyes with one
hand and groping for the stranger&rsquo;s with the other,
&ldquo;the relief was too much for me.&nbsp; How can I ever thank
you for being so kind and c-clever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can postpone that till another day, Miss
Carstairs&mdash;don&rsquo;t be alarmed: I saw it on your
luggage,&rdquo; the other said, with a reassuring
handclasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s Hilda Risk, though I&rsquo;m
quite a cautious person, as a rule.&nbsp; To-night I made an
exception,&rdquo; she went on, giving Kitty time to recover
herself, &ldquo;and interfered in a way that must have seemed
rather extraordinary to you.&nbsp; But I simply couldn&rsquo;t
help it.&nbsp; I noticed you before you got into the train, and I
saw you were troubled and nervous.&nbsp; I noticed the&mdash;oh,
well, the gentleman arrive at the last moment and get on board
after glaring about him.&nbsp; And as I happened to be just next
door to you, and in a seat next the corridor, I observed him
prowling along, ever so often, and taking stock of your
compartment.&nbsp; And every time he appeared, I admired him
less&mdash;I hardly know why.&nbsp; And the last time he came I
saw him grin.&nbsp; And when he entered your compartment I tried
calling myself a fool, and telling myself it was none of my
business, but I couldn&rsquo;t rest, and after a little while I
took the <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>chance of putting my foot in it dreadfully&mdash;and you
know the rest.&nbsp; Feeling better now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, thank you,&rdquo; Kitty answered, turning her
attention from her eyes to her pretty hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you
were so cool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I was.&nbsp; Once I&rsquo;ve made up my mind
to do a thing, I get that way.&nbsp; Besides, I&rsquo;m never
afraid of a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never afraid of a man!&rdquo; cried Kitty in tones of
such amazement that her new friend checked a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; because, you see, a man in his soul is always
afraid of a woman.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a useful thing to remember,
Miss Carstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but do you&mdash;hate men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary!&nbsp; Most of my friends are
men.&nbsp; Here comes the tea; now we&rsquo;ll be
happy!&rdquo;&nbsp; The attendant placed the tray on the seat,
beamed on Miss Risk and withdrew.</p>
<p>Kitty looked like crying again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re hungry,&rdquo; said Hilda.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fall to on the bread and butter, and I&rsquo;ll pour
out.&nbsp; It requires a little practice, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She proceeded to talk about herself, explaining, much to
Kitty&rsquo;s interest, that she was a journalist.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Most of my work consists of &lsquo;specials&rsquo; for
<i>The Lady&rsquo;s Mirror</i>, rather a swagger weekly, though
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>quite
young.&nbsp; I &lsquo;do&rsquo; all sorts of big functions, swell
weddings, and so forth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a knack for making
dreary things look bright in print, also a knack for making the
dull remarks of prominent persons seem brilliant.&nbsp; These are
the chief reasons, I fancy, why the Editor sends me all the way
from London instead of employing some one on the spot.&nbsp; I
have just come from Aberdeen, and if you read my article in the
next week&rsquo;s <i>Mirror</i>, you will imagine that I was in
fairyland instead of in the worst of weather, at a damaged garden
party, among a few hundred ordinary humans who wished themselves
at home!&nbsp; But I enjoyed myself&mdash;I generally
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked as if she did, thought Kitty, venturing for the
first time to take note of her new friend&rsquo;s
appearance.&nbsp; Hilda inclined to fairness.&nbsp; Her hair was
a pale brown without tinge of red, and her fine skin was almost
pale, though the lips were warmly coloured.&nbsp; Her nose was
short and straight, her chin, while nicely rounded, hinted at a
certain boldness&mdash;not aggressiveness&mdash;of
character.&nbsp; Her dark, bluish-grey eyes were unusually
wide-set, and this peculiarity&mdash;for it was
such&mdash;affected you first as merely piquant, but ere long as
very charming with its suggestion <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>of sincerity and honesty.&nbsp; She
was probably six or seven years older than Kitty.&nbsp; She
chatted on about herself and her work till she saw that Kitty had
made a fair meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling pretty fit now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
said encouragingly, and rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite different; I don&rsquo;t know what to say to
you, Miss Risk,&rdquo; Kitty said gratefully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so good to me&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t
know a thing about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask two questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask anything&mdash;please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just two for the present.&nbsp; Have you friends
meeting you at Euston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where do you want to go on your arrival in
London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda nodded gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see you have a
story,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but even if you wish to tell it, I
want you to keep it back&mdash;for the present, at any
rate.&nbsp; You and I must have a nap, or we shall be mere wrecks
at the end of the journey&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve pages to cover
before lunch-time.&nbsp; Ah, here he comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attendant appeared carrying pillows and rugs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be disturbed,
Miss,&rdquo; <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>he said, ere he retired with the tray and the silver
Hilda had laid on it.</p>
<p>Two minutes later she had Kitty tucked up on one of the
seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go to sleep without wasting a moment in worrying
over what&rsquo;s going to happen a few hours hence.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll manage nicely.&nbsp; Leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kitty left it.&nbsp; She was not used to being taken care
of, but even the novelty of that experience did not long
withstand slumber.&nbsp; In a few minutes she had forgotten it
along with her weariness and woes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>As the porter took their things, Hilda whispered to
Kitty&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look about you; and if you happen to see
him, don&rsquo;t show it.&nbsp; Come along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, they were driving westwards in an open
taxi-cab.&nbsp; It was a lovely morning, and the air was
delicious after the confinement of the long journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nice country colour you have,&rdquo; Hilda
remarked, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re not a country-bred girl, are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;Because you take all this as a matter of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that I don&rsquo;t seem excited?&nbsp; But,
you see, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we are going?&rdquo; said Hilda, taking a quick
glance behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I rude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; A most natural thing to wonder
about.&nbsp; Well, at the present, we are going to
call&mdash;just for a moment&mdash;on my rich and only brother,
who does not approve of my way of life, though he&rsquo;s as good
as any brother could be.&nbsp; After I have given him a message
you are coming home with me for breakfast&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
enough to go on with, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know anything about me!&rdquo;
cried Kitty.</p>
<p>Hilda&rsquo;s smile was very kind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I certainly
don&rsquo;t know your pedigree, nor the name and address of your
dentist; but I believe I could guess almost as much as you could
tell me concerning your recent troubles.&nbsp; However, you can
tell me what you will, later on.&nbsp; Meantime, take it easy and
get up an appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab turned to the left, negotiating a maze of streets of
varied aspect, and at last drew up at the imposing doorway of
Aberdare Mansions.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;We shall take our things with us,&rdquo; said
Hilda, &ldquo;and find another cab when we need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the hall, waiting for the lift, she said: &ldquo;Now
don&rsquo;t be alarmed.&nbsp; Our friend of last night followed
us in another taxi, and has doubtless noted the address.&nbsp; I
fancied he would do something like that, and accordingly we have
stopped here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To put him on a wrong scent!&rdquo; Kitty exclaimed
almost gleefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;How clever you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s go up and give my brother the
message.&nbsp; Our things can lie here till we come down
again.&nbsp; In you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soared to the fourth floor, where the conductress rang at
the door on the right.&nbsp; A discreet-looking man-servant
opened, and permitted himself to smile a welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Sharp,&rdquo; said Hilda.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not coming in.&nbsp; I want to see Mr. Risk
for twenty seconds.&nbsp; As it&rsquo;s so early, he may come in
his dressing-gown.&nbsp; Tell him it&rsquo;s most
urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly Sharp was used to Miss Risk&rsquo;s ways, for he went
without hesitation, and before long his master, garbed as Hilda
had suggested, came forward.&nbsp; He was tall, thin,
clean-shaven, and <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>you would have known him as Hilda&rsquo;s brother by his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he exclaimed at the sight of
Kitty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; he added
quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it, Hilda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this, John.&nbsp; If a gentleman, more or less,
should call here with inquiries about a Miss Kitty Carstairs, you
will oblige by treating him as you would treat an undesirable
person inquiring for your own sister.&nbsp; And please instruct
Sharp accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Risk, without the slightest
emotion of any kind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember, and so
shall Sharp.&nbsp; But may I know the gentleman&rsquo;s name,
more or less?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda turned to Kitty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Symington,&rdquo; murmured Kitty, with a lovely,
shameful colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. . . .&nbsp; But, my dear sister, where are
your manners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Hilda&rsquo;s turn to blush.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Miss
Carstairs, do forgive me!&nbsp; That wretched man put everything
out of my head.&nbsp; Let me introduce my brother, Mr.
Risk&mdash;Miss Carstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Risk held out his hand&mdash;apparently he had forgotten
his costume&mdash;and the embarrassed girl could not but take
it.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&ldquo;I never wonder at my sister making
friends,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, &ldquo;but I do marvel that
she keeps any.&nbsp; Well, Hilda, won&rsquo;t you and Miss
Carstairs stay and take breakfast with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible&mdash;thanks all the same.&nbsp; Good-bye,
John, and don&rsquo;t forget the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he retorted teasingly, &ldquo;and treat
all inquiring gentlemen as you requested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda went laughing into the lift, and Kitty, feeling the
friendly clasp of her arm, smiled almost happily.</p>
<h2><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the same hour, some four hundred
miles away, Kitty&rsquo;s absence was being felt.&nbsp; It was
time to open the post office, and John Corrie was realizing that
he would have more than enough to do until he secured a new
assistant&mdash;whom he would have to pay!</p>
<p>Corrie had just opened the shop.&nbsp; Outside the boy was
cleaning the windows; inside Miss Corrie was setting things
straight on the provision counter.&nbsp; He himself was bending
at the open safe, taking out the usual supplies of silver and
copper for the tills.&nbsp; These were contained in ancient
battered pewter mugs, and now he laid the mugs on the floor
preparatory to closing and locking up the safe.</p>
<p>An impatient knocking came from the post office, and he cursed
under his breath.&nbsp; But it was already five minutes past
eight, and it would never do to have talk about the office not
being opened punctually.&nbsp; Rising, he called to his sister to
look after the money, and hastened away to admit the knocker.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Miss
Corrie moved listlessly towards the safe.&nbsp; Her face had a
drawn look.&nbsp; She had not slept.&nbsp; She had spoken scarce
a word to her brother since Kitty&rsquo;s departure, and neither
she nor Sam, whom she had helped with the sorting this morning,
had referred to the previous evening&rsquo;s affair.&nbsp; Sam
and Corrie had not yet met.</p>
<p>But, a yard from the safe, the woman&rsquo;s listlessness
vanished, her face flamed, and then went more pallid than
ever.&nbsp; Never before had her brother done such a
thing!!&mdash;gone out of the shop, leaving his keys in the
safe.&nbsp; Her opportunity at last!</p>
<p>She ran softly to the door that opened on the post office and
put her ear to it.&nbsp; Several persons were demanding the
postmaster&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; There was time as well as
opportunity!&nbsp; She darted back to the safe . . . opened it,
then the drawer on the left . . . searched . . . and found what
she sought&mdash;the letter written to her brother by
Kitty&rsquo;s father when he was dying.&nbsp; She hid it in her
bosom, to read when she might safely do so.&nbsp; She left the
safe as she had found it, took up the mugs of money and proceeded
to supply the tills with change.&nbsp; The letter seemed to
scorch her breast.&nbsp; She could not wait.</p>
<p>Summoning the boy, she bade him keep an eye <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>on the shop
for a few minutes, and passed into the cottage.&nbsp; In the
kitchen, she seated herself at the hearth and, quaking, took out
the letter.&nbsp; The only portion which concerns us is the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You may perhaps find nothing in the
enclosed share certificates (which, please note, are
&lsquo;bearer&rsquo;) but a fresh evidence of my folly in worldly
matters.&nbsp; Still, the Zenith Gold Mine is the only thing of
the kind I ever put hard-earned money into.&nbsp; There are 5,000
&pound;1 shares, and I paid 2s. apiece for them, and at the
moment they are unsaleable.&nbsp; I acted on the advice of a
friend who had seen the property, and who had knowledge of such
things.&nbsp; He was convinced that the mine would come right in
time&mdash;meaning years&mdash;and pay big dividends.&nbsp; Well,
he may have been all wrong, and I the silliest of poor fools; but
now, John, I put the shares in your keeping as a
&lsquo;possibility&rsquo; for Kitty, when she comes of age.&nbsp;
I have never mentioned them to her&mdash;certainly not with any
reference to herself&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t want her to be more
disappointed in me than I can help.&nbsp; Give them to her when
she is twenty-one, and show her this letter, and if by any chance
they are worth money then, or later, she will at least <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>repay you
what she may have cost you&mdash;though, of course, I am hoping
she will earn enough to do that as she goes along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N.B.&mdash;Should you hear of the shares rising before
then, you will just use your discretion, and do the best you can
for my girl.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Corrie swayed as though she would fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
that&rsquo;s why he would never let me read it properly!&rdquo;
she muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, John Corrie, what ha&rsquo; ye
done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little while she obtained control over her body.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What made him keep a thing like that?&nbsp; It should
ha&rsquo; been burned&mdash;burned and forgot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached forward, held the letter over the fire&mdash;and
drew it back.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what if he misses it from the
safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In miserable uncertainty she began to re-read the
document.&nbsp; In the midst of it she went rigid.&nbsp; Her
brother was coming through the shop, calling her.&nbsp; Her
fingers fumbled at her bodice.&nbsp; Too late!&nbsp; In her panic
her eye was caught by the morning&rsquo;s paper lying on the
floor at her side.&nbsp; She snatched it up, pushed the letter
into the folds, and made pretence of reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong wi&rsquo; ye?&rdquo; said Corrie,
entering.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;I was just looking at the price of
Zeniths,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away and attend to the post office,&rdquo; he
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mun be in the shop this forenoon. . .
.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo;&nbsp; To take the paper with her would be
sheer madness, she reflected quickly; besides he was done with
it.&nbsp; She would come back for it at the first
opportunity.&nbsp; Letting it fall where she had found it, she
got up and left the kitchen.</p>
<p>He followed her, growling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>At half-past eleven, the morning delivery finished, Sam, as
was his custom, came into the shop to purchase a paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no&rsquo; one left,&rdquo; said the
boy.</p>
<p>From the opposite counter, where he was serving a customer,
Corrie called to the boy&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll get one in the house.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
not the first time he had sold his own paper to the postman.</p>
<p>So presently the boy came back with the paper, and Sam,
folding it up, put it in his pocket, and went home to see what
was happening in the great world.</p>
<h2><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Fortunately</span> for his stomach&rsquo;s
sake, at any rate, it was the weekly half-holiday, so that Mr.
Corrie, having closed the shop at one, was free to relieve his
sister in the post office and dispatch her to prepare, with all
speed, something in the way of dinner.&nbsp; He was a little
astonished at the eagerness with which she departed to do his
bidding.</p>
<p>A minute later she was back, looking as though she had seen a
ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, where&rsquo;s the paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning paper.&nbsp; Quick!&mdash;what ha&rsquo; ye
done wi&rsquo; it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned from the counter with a grunt of impatience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Get my dinner ready and never heed about the paper!&nbsp;
If ye want to ken, Zeniths dropped six-and-threepence
yesterday&mdash;no&rsquo; that it matters to us now.&nbsp; Away
wi&rsquo; ye and hurry up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;John, for the love o&rsquo; God, tell me where
the paper is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That startled him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What the mischief&rsquo;s
wrong wi&rsquo; ye, woman?&rdquo; he demanded, regarding her
frowningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sam, the postman, got the paper.&nbsp;
There wasna another in the shop&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment&rsquo;s space she gazed at him as though he had
said something too awful for belief.&nbsp; Then, with a wail, she
threw up her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the beginning o&rsquo; the
judgment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&nbsp; Are ye daft?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He seized her roughly by the arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter was inside the paper,&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter!&nbsp; What letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh Carstairs&rsquo; letter about the shares. . . . I
took it from the safe to read it. . . .&nbsp; When I heard ye
coming to the kitchen I was feared, and I hid it in the paper. .
. .&nbsp; I&mdash;I didna mean to betray ye, John, but&mdash;oh,
dinna look at me like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;!&rdquo; he stormed, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ve ruined
me, damned me!&rdquo;&nbsp; For an instant it seemed as though he
would smite her, but he flung away, saying, &ldquo;Get out
o&rsquo; my sight!&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ve done for your
brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, for all his passion, his mind was working <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>quickly.&nbsp; He recalled her as she tottered through
the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just a chance he hasna opened it
yet.&nbsp; Haste ye to his house and tell him ye want a sight
o&rsquo; it for ten minutes.&nbsp; Make any excuse ye like, but
gang quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willingly she went, poor soul, for with all her being she
loved this brother of hers, contemptible thief though he was.</p>
<p>John Corrie lived a hideous age in the ten minutes that
followed.&nbsp; Then Rachel returned with the paper in her hand,
but everything else about her told him she had failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll offer him
every penny I possess&rdquo;&mdash;she had laid by nearly two
thousand pounds&mdash;&ldquo;for the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As though he had not heard her he passed into the empty,
semi-dark shop, and sank on a chair at the counter.&nbsp; He was
weak and sick with dread.</p>
<p>She followed, and repeated her suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I mun think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly she left him, and in the kitchen recovered herself
sufficiently to set about preparing some strong tea.</p>
<p>An hour passed before he joined her, and started to pace the
floor.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;Ye read the letter?&rdquo; he asked at last,
abruptly, in a repressed voice.</p>
<p>She nodded, her mouth quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye ken what it means in the hands o&rsquo; an
enemy&mdash;a friend o&rsquo; Hugh Carstairs&rsquo; daughter? . .
.&nbsp; Jail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John! . . .&nbsp; But he&rsquo;ll maybe sell it to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently she said: &ldquo;Sit down, dearie, and try a cup
o&rsquo; tea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made it fresh for ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on pacing.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what about
Symington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye were to tell him the truth,
maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was thinking,&rdquo; she said meekly, &ldquo;he
might help ye for his own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way he can help me is to marry your niece
within the three months, getting her promise at once, of
course.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something maybe happened in the train last
night,&rdquo; she ventured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be hearing
from him in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;where she got
the money to gang to London wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s hand went to her flat breast.</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;John, did she no&rsquo; take it from the post
office, as ye said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the sullen answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John, John! . . .&nbsp; But ye&rsquo;ve enough to
bear now without me reproaching ye.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a pause
she continued: &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to send Sam her
address afore he can do anything wi&rsquo; the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye; but they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; such fools as to
communicate wi&rsquo; each other through this office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody in the office,&rdquo; he said
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; she interposed; &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re
no&rsquo; fit.&nbsp; Take your tea till I come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was absent several minutes, and on her return she was
cheered by seeing him at the table and the cup empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it, and what were ye doing in the shop?&rdquo;
he asked, more from habit than interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Hayward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him!&nbsp; What was he wanting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A notebook, and he was terrible particular about the
size.&nbsp; He had a piece o&rsquo; paper with the measurements
wrote on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye wouldna find anything fine enough to suit
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;But I did.&nbsp; There was one left o&rsquo; the
half-dozen that ye got once for Mr. Symington.&nbsp; He said it
was the very thing. . . .&nbsp; Could ye no&rsquo; eat
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was brooding again, and minutes passed ere he roused
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That postman&rsquo;s got me,&rdquo; he muttered
bitterly, &ldquo;got me as never a man was got before.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m cornered.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll hear from the girl
to-morrow&mdash;they&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; planned about writing, ye
can be sure&mdash;and then he&rsquo;ll get to work wi&rsquo; the
letter.&nbsp; God!&nbsp; I feel like making a bolt for
it&mdash;but where can a man hide in these days o&rsquo; wireless
telegrams and so forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; All at once he turned on her
snarling: &ldquo;What for did ye interfere wi&rsquo; my private
affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She winced and shuddered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord kens I&rsquo;m
sorry,&rdquo; she whimpered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And He kens I would do
anything to help ye now.&nbsp; John, is there anything I can
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he replied with a dreadful ironic laugh,
&ldquo;ye can burn the cursed letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaping, she gazed at him.&nbsp; What did he mean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only, ye would likewise need to burn the
postman&rsquo;s house over his head, and that within the next
twelve hours.&rdquo;&nbsp; The laugh came again and died into
silence.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>The
woman&rsquo;s face lost its foolish laxness; she seemed to
stiffen all over.&nbsp; And suddenly she screamed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it. . . .&nbsp; John, I&rsquo;ll do it
for your sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he shouted, and started to his feet.</p>
<p>She staggered, recovered, and rushed from the kitchen.&nbsp;
When he followed he found that she had locked herself in her own
room.</p>
<p>He passed into the dim shop and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she mean it?&rdquo; he asked of the shadows.&nbsp;
And later&mdash;&ldquo;Better her than me, for who would ever
suspect her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evening when she came out.&nbsp; She went about her
accustomed duties, but her countenance was grey and stony, and
she was as one stricken dumb.&nbsp; And he, being afraid to ask a
certain question and incapable of thinking of aught else, was
dumb also.&nbsp; They retired at the usual hour of ten.</p>
<h2><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Colin&rsquo;s</span> change of mind with
respect to the hundred pounds had taken place within the hour
following his proud refusal.&nbsp; The thought of Kitty&rsquo;s
position in the event of a scandal was too much for him.&nbsp;
Dependent on the Corries, practically a prisoner in Dunford, the
sensitive girl would be bound to suffer terribly&mdash;and all on
account of himself.&nbsp; And so he had gone downstairs,
miserable enough, but prepared to tell his father that he would
take the money after all, prepared also for humiliation.&nbsp;
But, as we know, he was spared the latter.&nbsp; It should be
added that he did not for an instant doubt that the notes had
been deliberately left on the writing-table.&nbsp; His father was
not the man to be careless where money was concerned.</p>
<p>Well, he would send the notes to Kitty in such a way that she
could not suspect him.&nbsp; A hundred pounds would give her a
certain independence <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and power whatever happened; they
would open a way of escape if the need for that became
urgent.&nbsp; Colin did not ignore the possibility of her going
to London, but he honestly strove to extinguish the hope of
meeting her there.&nbsp; Had she not told him frankly that she
did not love him, and what was his worldly state that he should
dare to dream of any girl as his own?&nbsp; As an honourable man
he must go his own way and endeavour to forget those sweet stolen
hours in the woods around Dunford.</p>
<p>It is not to be assumed that Colin arrived in London
penniless.&nbsp; To be precise, he possessed the sum of &pound;15
1s. 1d, but whether such a considerable sum gives a young man a
better start than the proverbial half-crown may be left open to
question.&nbsp; With only thirty pence in his pocket a man dare
not pause to pick and choose, and perhaps that is the real secret
of the success of the half-crown adventurers&mdash;if they ever
really existed.</p>
<p>Colin had plenty of acquaintances, not to mention sundry
relations in London, but he had no desire to see them in his
present circumstances, nor did he imagine they would be rejoiced
to see him.&nbsp; Most of us can be quite kind to the failure,
but few of us can sincerely sympathize with him, <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>especially
when we conceive him to be a fool as well.</p>
<p>London held but one man whom Colin desired to meet.&nbsp; This
was Anthony West, a friend of his earlier student days.&nbsp;
West, who was several years the senior, had been a failure, too;
that is to say, he had stuck in the midst of his science course,
wriggled for a while between paternal wishes and personal
inclination, and been captured finally by the latter.&nbsp; A
writer of clever prose trifles and dainty verse, he had plunged
into journalism.&nbsp; The friends had not met since then, and
their correspondence had gradually ceased.&nbsp; West&rsquo;s
last letter had been written two years ago.</p>
<p>To the address on it Colin went on the morning of his
arrival.&nbsp; Mr. West, the landlady informed him, had left a
long time ago; she had no other information to give.&nbsp; Colin,
after recourse to the Directory, journeyed to a court off Fleet
Street, made some inquiries, entered a doorway of grimy and
forbidding appearance, ascended three flights of steep and narrow
stairs, and tapped at a door that had seen better days.&nbsp; A
shout bade him enter, and he advanced into the London
office&mdash;or part of it&mdash;of a provincial evening paper,
and the presence of his friend who, bowed and <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>scribbling at
a decrepit desk, took no notice of him.&nbsp; A more dismal and
dusty little room Colin had never been in.&nbsp; Poor old West
had evidently failed again.&nbsp; His heart was sinking fast when
the scribbler turned, stared and recognized him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is good!&rdquo; cried West.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit
down!&rdquo;&nbsp; From a broken easy chair he swept a pile of
newspapers and a dozen or so books for review.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,
take a cigarette, and give me ten minutes to finish
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scribbling was resumed, with the
remark&mdash;Greek to Colin: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s those dashed
Zeniths&mdash;started booming again this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of seven minutes he sat up, rang the bell, and
swung round towards his visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk!&rdquo; he said, wiping his brow with one hand,
and tapping a cigarette on the desk with the other.</p>
<p>A boy dashed in, grabbed the scribbled sheets, and fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still write verses?&rdquo; asked Colin
involuntarily.</p>
<p>West exploded with amusement.&nbsp; &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how
it strikes you!&nbsp; Yes, I do&mdash;not here&mdash;but never
mind me&mdash;what are you doing in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was the truthful enough answer.</p>
<p>West&rsquo;s gaze was kindly.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;Go on!&nbsp; Something tells me you are in a
hole, and if I can do anything to help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Anthony.&nbsp; I see you haven&rsquo;t
changed,&rdquo; said Colin gratefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you all about it, for I need advice badly.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
with commendable brevity he gave his friend an outline of his
affairs.</p>
<p>After he had ended the other remained silent, a brooding look
on his tired, rugged, honest face, for nearly a minute.&nbsp; He
spoke abruptly, but gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; What can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it can&rsquo;t be so bad as all that, Colin!&nbsp;
Do anything in the way of writing nowadays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t touched it for a year.&nbsp; You see, I
did make an attempt to please the governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And before that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a few small things accepted here and there,
locally, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I broke forcibly away from the
uncongenial myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so my sympathy is
genuine.&nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t mean falling into
clover.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m here from seven to twelve six days <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>a week doing
things I hate, and earning some money.&nbsp; For the rest of the
day I&rsquo;m free&mdash;and sometimes my brains are free,
too&mdash;to do things I like, which, however, seldom earn
anything.&nbsp; My income is about four pounds a week, and it
might stop any week.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m telling you these things,
Colin, not to discourage you, but simply to prepare
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But four pounds a week is rather good,&rdquo; said
Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought when I was a student, living at the cost
of my father.&nbsp; Why, now, I could easily spend it all on
books alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you married?&rdquo; Colin ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No . . .&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not complaining, you
know.&nbsp; Four quid is doubtless as much as I deserve, but
I&rsquo;d like to be able to look forward to something
bigger&mdash;only I daren&rsquo;t hope.&nbsp; If I were you,
Colin, I&rsquo;d leave writing&mdash;journalism or the other
thing&mdash;for a last resort.&nbsp; Take a look round and see
what you can see.&nbsp; I suppose you have some stuff to go on
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fifteen pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony frowned.&nbsp; &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t give you much
rope.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be
delighted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; interrupted Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll take it unkindly if you
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>get
stuck without letting me know.&nbsp; In spite of my groans
I&rsquo;ve always a bit to spare&mdash;at least nearly
always.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked at his watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five
minutes yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a little while he was gloomily
silent, then his face lightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what I&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you a note to a man who
is interested, financially and otherwise, in many things.&nbsp;
He might find you an opening somewhere.&nbsp; I once was able to
do him a small service, and he has a long memory. . . .&nbsp; Let
me see!&nbsp; This is Friday, and he doesn&rsquo;t come to the
City.&nbsp; Still, I believe he&rsquo;ll see you at his
house&mdash;say, about four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony shook his pen and scribbled a few lines, folded the
sheet, and put it in an envelope, which he addressed
to&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;John Risk,
Esq.,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;83 Aberdare Mansions,
W.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Handing over the letter he said: &ldquo;You may find him cool
at first; he is seldom anything else.&nbsp; Coolness seems to run
in his family.&nbsp; But whatever you are, be frank with
him.&nbsp; Come and see me to-night and report.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s my address.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have a chop for you at
seven&mdash;and a bed if you&rsquo;ll stay.&nbsp; And
now&rdquo;&mdash;he held out his hand&mdash;&ldquo;good
luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Colin
went out with a full heart.&nbsp; What a wonderful thing was
friendship!</p>
<p>At four to the minute he presented himself at 83 Aberdare
Mansions.&nbsp; He was evidently expected&mdash;it was like
Anthony to have &rsquo;phoned&mdash;for the servant on hearing
his name conducted him at once to a beautifully appointed
study.</p>
<p>The servant placed a chair and retired.&nbsp; The tall man who
had risen from the writing-table took West&rsquo;s note, saying
courteously, &ldquo;Be seated, Mr. Hayward.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sat
down himself and read the note, then said quietly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. West has the right to ask what he will of me, and
it appears that you are his worthy friend.&nbsp; Will you be good
enough to tell me what you care to tell about yourself, Mr.
Hayward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a less easy matter in the face of this calm, urbane
stranger than it had been with Anthony for listener to render a
succinct account of himself, but Colin omitted nothing, however
unflattering to himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Risk offered no comment, but he asked one or two
questions, which seemed to Colin rather idle, and then fell
silent and reflective.&nbsp; Suddenly he said: &ldquo;Do you
trust me?&rdquo;&nbsp; With some hesitation, but without the
least dubiety Colin answered: &ldquo;Certainly, Mr.
Risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;Then I will trust you,&rdquo; said Risk in his
matter-of-fact voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am going to give you a
trial,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and in the circumstances it is,
I admit, a rather curious one.&nbsp; You have, of course, the
option of refusing, but if you accept, kindly let it be done on
the understanding that you will obey my instructions
implicitly.&nbsp; Please understand, also, that the fact of your
coming from a place called Dunford, while it forms an odd
coincidence, and may be a help, has nothing to do with my
choosing you for this particular piece of work.&nbsp; I would
have asked you to perform it just the same had you come from the
Isle of Man.&nbsp; Well, now&rdquo;&mdash;he paused for a
moment&mdash;&ldquo;I have a letter here which I wish to be
delivered first thing in the morning to Mr. Alexander Symington,
White Farm, Dunford&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin checked words at his very lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A train leaves King&rsquo;s Cross at 5.45, and though
it does not usually stop at Dunford, I have arranged that it
shall do so for you shortly after 1 a.m.&nbsp; I hope you may be
able to find some sort of shelter until 6, when you will deliver
the letter.&nbsp; You will bring back an answer by the first
train possible and report to me here.&nbsp; By the way, you are,
perhaps, acquainted with Mr. Symington?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;Very slightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin smiled faintly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is quite unknown to me,&rdquo; the other
proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am curious to know, however, just how
he looks when he reads this letter, and you must try to manage
that for me.&nbsp; Here is the letter.&nbsp; There is no need for
me to make a mystery of it&mdash;a simple business
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter was typed on a large sheet bearing the heading
&ldquo;The Zenith Gold Mining Company, Limited,&rdquo; and ran as
follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have your letter of yesterday&rsquo;s date covering
the Certificate (Bearer) for 500 shares, Nos. 23501 to 24600,
which you desire to have converted into five certificates for 100
shares each.&nbsp; This is having our attention.&nbsp; Meantime,
will you kindly inform us at what date, as nearly as possible,
you purchased the shares numbered as above.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was signed by the Secretary of the Company.</p>
<p>Colin handed it back, remarking: &ldquo;It seems a simple
enough matter, Mr. Risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;I hope so.&nbsp; Now, are you prepared to go
through with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; You are not likely to encounter your
friends at so early an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
under a very black cloud, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, you are not keen on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m keen on carrying it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk nodded as much as to say: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right
spirit,&rdquo; and laid a couple of bank-notes on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your expenses,&rdquo; he said, and added a few
instructions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. West shall be advised that you are
leaving town, so you don&rsquo;t need to trouble about your
engagement with him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look for you to-morrow
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that the interview was at an end, Colin rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, Mr. Risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect that of you, Mr. Hayward,&rdquo; said the
other, ringing the bell.</p>
<p>At the gate of the lift Colin stood aside to allow a lady to
emerge.&nbsp; Their eyes met for an instant, and he noticed that
hers were unusually luminous and wide-set.&nbsp; Then his mind
went back to the business on hand.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Mr. Risk as his sister came
in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope I didn&rsquo;t interrupt your muse in its
description of some poor wretch&rsquo;s wedding
garments&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did!&nbsp; The only amends you can make is to ring
for tea and tell me why you wired for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give you tea perhaps,&rdquo; he said, pressing a
button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, John!&nbsp; What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Miss Carstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda sat up.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a friend of
mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is&mdash;but why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you know about her,&rdquo; he said
seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t, John,&rdquo; she
replied, after a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m under promise not
to repeat what she told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity.&nbsp; Where did you meet
her?&nbsp; Glasgow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;on the train, last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me where she came from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I may tell you that much.&nbsp; Dunford is the
name of the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&nbsp; Dunford seems to be emigrating to
London!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;What do you mean, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing for you, Hilda.&nbsp; Did she mention her
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me he was dead.&nbsp; He was a
journalist.&nbsp; They used to live in Glasgow.&nbsp; I had
better not say more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, you&rsquo;ve told me all I want to know about
Miss Carstairs&mdash;for the present.&nbsp; Now what can you tell
me about the mysterious Mr. Symington, whose head you instructed
me to punch on his calling here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, has he been?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience!&nbsp; I may be wrong, but I fancy he is still
in Dunford.&nbsp; In fact, I&rsquo;ve just dispatched a
messenger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s in London&mdash;or was
this morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you say so this
morning?&rdquo; Risk asked without irritation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that you would understand that he
was&mdash;was after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, I don&rsquo;t wish to belittle your
attractions, or Miss Carstairs&rsquo;, but I wish you had been
more explicit at the time.&nbsp; I merely thought that in the
course of one of your escapades you had favoured an objectionable
person with your brother&rsquo;s address instead of your
own&mdash;an <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>admirable expedient I admit&mdash;but I had not thought
of the person being on your very heels, as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you know of him?&rdquo; she asked, looking
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Zenith secretary sent me a letter this morning
which had come from a Mr. Symington, of Dunford, and now you have
strengthened my suspicion induced by the letter that he is also
the objectionable person.&nbsp; Of course, there may be another
Mr. Symington in Dunford, so I&rsquo;ll let my messenger go
ahead.&nbsp; It will be good training for him anyway&mdash;test
his discretion and so on.&nbsp; What does Miss Carstairs say
about Symington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she mentioned a Mr. Hayward&mdash;Colin
Hayward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the servant brought tea.&nbsp; When he had retired,
Hilda said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, do tell me what it all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
yet.&nbsp; It may all mean nothing of any consequence.&nbsp; On
the other hand it may mean something of considerable
importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your new friend.&nbsp; Now hold your tongue, and
pour out.&rdquo;</p>

108</span>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the darkness of the hour
preceding dawn John Corrie, fully dressed, lay on his bed
listening.&nbsp; The sound he had been dreading yet yearning for
had come at last.&nbsp; His sister was moving in the room
above.&nbsp; The atmosphere was sultry, yet the man
shivered.&nbsp; Was Rachel about to attempt the deed that might
save him, or was she only restlessly repenting of her wild
promise?&nbsp; If the former, should he stop her, or let her take
her self-appointed course?&nbsp; One question led to another, but
none got an answer.</p>
<p>At last he was aware that she was cautiously opening her
door.&nbsp; He did not move.&nbsp; He heard her come stealthily
down the stair, pausing after every creak.&nbsp; Presently he
caught a glimpse of light under his door.&nbsp; It vanished, yet
not so suddenly as though a candle had been blown out.&nbsp; She
must have turned into the passage leading to the shop.&nbsp; What
could she be wanting there at such an hour?&nbsp; He pretended to
himself that he could not guess.</p>
<p>After a little while the light returned with her <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>footsteps.&nbsp; It remained in his vision during the
short silence that ensued.&nbsp; The silence ended in a heavy
sigh.&nbsp; John Corrie lay very still.</p>
<p>The light went out.&nbsp; He heard her groping her way to the
front door.&nbsp; He heard it
open&mdash;close&mdash;softly.&nbsp; She was gone on her dark
errand, and he had deliberately let her go.&nbsp; Nothing he
could ever do or suffer in this world would redeem his soul from
that loathsome disgrace.&nbsp; But John Corrie was not thinking
of his soul then.</p>
<p>He sprang up, lit a candle and ran upstairs; thence he peeped
from a window.&nbsp; He was in time to see a cloaked figure fade
into the misty murk.&nbsp; The cloak bulged at one side.&nbsp;
What was she carrying in it concealed?&nbsp; Again he pretended
he could not guess.&nbsp; Returning downstairs he pretended also
not to feel the strong, rank odour of paraffin, nor to notice the
drips on the passage from the shop.</p>
<p>He returned to his bed, but now he kept the candle burning,
for he was afraid of the darkness.&nbsp; And ere three minutes
had passed, he rose, shaken with a new terror.&nbsp; What if the
holder of the letter should, in spite of all, escape with it? . .
.&nbsp; For a moment he wavered on the verge of collapse, then
the very terror itself stiffened his nerves, cleared his mind,
and drove him to action.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>In an
amazingly short time he was following the path taken by his
sister.&nbsp; He wore no cloak, but both his side pockets bulged,
and he carried a club-like staff.&nbsp; He sped swiftly through
the slumbering village.&nbsp; He was sweating and shivering, and
once his whole being leapt as if jerked at the whistle of a
distant train.&nbsp; He did not intend to overtake Rachel; she
must do her work deeming herself unobserved; yet he did not wish
to be far behind her.&nbsp; Clear of the village, he began to
trot on the grass at the side of the road.</p>
<p>Years ago a sanguine and enterprising individual had caused to
be erected by the roadside, midway between station and village, a
superior sort of timber shanty, and had labelled it
&ldquo;Cyclists&rsquo; Rest&mdash;Temperance
Refreshments.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were plenty of cyclists in the
summer, and numerous pedestrians also, but somehow few of them
seemed to be tired or thirsty; and at the end of the second
season the sanguine and enterprising individual departed, unseen
by human eye, leaving a small selection of aerated waters in the
refreshment-room and sundry little debts for lodging and so forth
in the village.&nbsp; Eventually the building fell to the only
bidder, Sam, the postman, who converted it into two apartments,
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>and a
fairly snug home of which he was inclined to be proud.</p>
<p>A mere strip of garden separated the house from the road, but
Sam kept it bright with flowers for eight months of the
year.&nbsp; The front of the house was painted a pale
stone-colour; the porch, the door, and the two quartets of tall,
extremely narrow windows were coloured white.&nbsp; Altogether it
provided a gay relief from the sober moorland behind it.&nbsp;
Across the road, and separated from it by a deep ditch usually
dry in summer, lay a strip of moor gently sloping upwards to the
wood, through which a path supplied a short cut from the station
to the village.&nbsp; There was no other dwelling within five
minutes&rsquo; walk.</p>
<p>When John Corrie&rsquo;s eyes began dimly to discern the house
he slowed his pace till he was stealing forward with every
appearance of caution and alertness.&nbsp; Suddenly he stopped
short, dropped on hands and knees, and let himself down into the
ditch where he crouched, holding his breath.</p>
<p>A vague figure was coming hurriedly from behind the
house.&nbsp; On reaching the road it broke into a shambling run,
its dark garment flapping like the wings of some huge night
bird.&nbsp; As it passed the lurking watcher it panted and
sobbed.&nbsp; <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>Presently it disappeared round a bend, and the watcher
heaved a sigh of angry relief.&nbsp; That was the worst of women:
they could do nothing without making a fuss!</p>
<p>He drew himself from the ditch, and now his head and most of
his face were covered with a heavy black muffler.&nbsp; Keeping
to the grass, he darted towards the house.&nbsp; Opposite it, he
halted for a moment, almost overcome by the thudding of his
heart.&nbsp; Just then he perceived a thin smoke rising from the
rear of the house&mdash;from the attached shed; he guessed that
contained the postman&rsquo;s store of coal and wood.&nbsp; That
nerved him again.&nbsp; It was now or never.</p>
<p>Dropping his bludgeon, he brought from his pocket a hank of
thin, strong rope, shook it out and tip-toed across the
road.&nbsp; He was about to fasten one end to the door handle
with the view to securing it to a pillar of the porch, when he
bethought himself of another, though barely possible way.&nbsp;
With fearful care he turned the handle&mdash;and lo, the door
gave!&nbsp; Chance had favoured him!&nbsp; Sam had forgotten to
lock it&mdash;not for the first time.</p>
<p>Sweating, John Corrie opened the door about a foot, put round
his hand and removed the key from the lock.&nbsp; Then with
infinite gentleness he <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>drew the door shut, inserted the
key, turned it and withdrew it.&nbsp; Almost fainting he
recrossed the road, took up his staff, and fell rather than
descended into the ditch.</p>
<p>A faint breeze was stirring at last.&nbsp; Smoke blown over
the tarred roof of the shanty drifted to his nostrils.&nbsp; For
a while, fingering the key, he seemed to hesitate; then, turning,
he tossed it from him among the heather.&nbsp; The rope he coiled
up and let fall at his feet.&nbsp; He crouched, staring at the
house.</p>
<p>And presently a spark floated up, hovered and died.&nbsp; But
others followed, thicker and thicker, and a glow appeared under
them.&nbsp; Crackling sounds broke the silence, softly, timidly
at first, but soon with noisy boldness.&nbsp; The breeze gained
in strength.&nbsp; A fiery tongue waved above the roof, subsided,
rose again and licked the tarry surface; ere long it was joined
by others.&nbsp; A low roaring mingled with the crackling.&nbsp;
The narrow windows were still dark, but smoke began to stream
from the ventilator over the door.&nbsp; Woe to the sleeper if he
did not waken now!</p>
<p>Cold with terror, fascinated by horror, Corrie knelt in his
lair and gazed and gazed.&nbsp; Suddenly a light sprang into
being in the room on the left&mdash;a small light that lasted but
a moment.&nbsp; The <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>sleeper had wakened and struck a
match.&nbsp; Corrie wondered if he would wait to light a candle,
but in the next moment the windows went dark.&nbsp; Sounds
followed: a cry, the noise of a chair overturned, hurried
footfalls on a bare plank floor.&nbsp; Then Corrie put his hands
under the muffler and thrust his fingers in his ears.&nbsp; For
the inmate was trying to open the door.</p>
<p>The flames were now rising high above the roof; smoke was
pouring from the ventilator, trickling from under the door and
through crevices about the windows and walls.&nbsp; A reddish
glow behind the windows on the left caused the watcher to shut
his eyes.&nbsp; But he could no longer close his ears to agony,
for the prisoner was raining blows with some heavy implement on
the door and lock.&nbsp; Once more Corrie was roused to
action.&nbsp; What if the holder of the letter should escape with
it after all?&nbsp; He readjusted the black muffler about his
head till little more than his eyes remained uncovered, took a
fresh grip on his staff, and held himself in readiness.&nbsp; The
blows became frantic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Up yonder in the wood, Colin Hayward, fagged with the long
railway journey and much thinking, had thrown himself down to
await the morning.&nbsp; <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>He was almost asleep when the sound
of knocking made him raise his head from his arms.&nbsp; As he
did so he became conscious of a strong smell of burning
timber.&nbsp; The sound, coupled with the odour, struck him as
odd at that hour.&nbsp; He got up and crossed the few yards which
lay between him and the verge of the wood.&nbsp; From there he
looked down on fire and smoke, and quickly realized that the
burning thing was the abode of his old friend Sam, the
postman.&nbsp; He descended the slope as swiftly as the darkness,
the treacherous ground, and the slippery heather permitted.</p>
<p>At last the lock was shattered, the door torn inwards.&nbsp;
The hatchet fell from Sam&rsquo;s hand as, spent and coughing
most grievously, he staggered forth to reel across the road,
bare-footed, in a long grey night-shirt.&nbsp; At the grass he
stumbled and fell helplessly, in the heaving torment of
smoke-charged lungs.</p>
<p>He was beginning to revive, when behind him, rising from hands
and knees, John Corrie clubbed him over the
head&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;and would have struck again but
that there was no need.&nbsp; Sam lay on his face, one hand
clutching grass, the other under him, clenched against his
breast.&nbsp; With a sob of terror, Corrie threw his cudgel into
the ditch and turned his victim over.&nbsp; And now <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>the back of
the house was well ablaze, and in the yellow light even small
things became plain.&nbsp; The clenched hand, for instance, held
a crushed piece of paper&mdash;the little, terrible thing, the
recovery of which meant salvation to Corrie.&nbsp; He went down
on his knees to prise open the grasping fingers, but they fell
apart of their own accord.&nbsp; He took the letter.&nbsp; He
gloated over it.&nbsp; The latter proceeding was folly; his
moment of exultation was to cost him dear.&nbsp; Hearing dulled
by excitement and the thick muffler did not warn him until too
late.&nbsp; He scrambled to his feet only to be seized viciously
from behind by the collar and shaken like a rat.&nbsp; Then a
cruel grip on his wrist caused him to drop the precious letter,
and a savage kick sent him five yards beyond it on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You beastly coward!&rdquo; cried a voice he knew, and
all panic-stricken he picked himself up and fled.</p>
<p>Colin had started to pursue, when a groan from the stricken
one recalled him.&nbsp; He picked up the letter, deeming that it
must be of importance, stuffed it into his pocket, and proceeded
to do what he could for Sam.&nbsp; Perhaps, after all, his
student days had not been wholly wasted.&nbsp; But Sam was sore
hurt.&nbsp; His home was a fiery furnace, and he neither knew nor
cared.</p>

117</span>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following afternoon Kitty
and her new friend were lounging in the latter&rsquo;s
sitting-room, one of the four apartments of a little,
old-fashioned, top flat in Long Acre.&nbsp; The situation of Miss
Risk&rsquo;s home had its drawbacks, but it was a most convenient
one for her business, and she had given the house itself a charm
and comfort not to be despised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go on being your guest
indefinitely,&rdquo; Kitty was saying from her seat at the open
window.</p>
<p>Hilda, stretched on the couch, smiled and then yawned.&nbsp;
She had had a hard morning&rsquo;s work, and the heat was
oppressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been here for about thirty hours,&rdquo; she
returned in a lazy voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it seems
like years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean, Miss Risk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you might call me by my pretty name.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; said Kitty
diffidently, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re afraid of me, Kitty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say &lsquo;but&rsquo; again, I&rsquo;ll go to
sleep!&nbsp; Now listen, Kitty!&nbsp; You have told me a good
many things about yourself, so you can no longer argue that I
know nothing about you.&nbsp; I know far more about you than you
know about me.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is, Miss&mdash;Hilda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, if you keep talking about leaving me, the
only conclusion I can draw is that you don&rsquo;t like staying
with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;or that you are absurdly proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty hung her head.</p>
<p>Hilda gave a little nod of understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; she said kindly, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you
trust me and let me protect you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never had any
one to protect except myself.&nbsp; Come and sit beside
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger girl came slowly over to the couch, faltered, and
fell on her knees, crying&mdash;&ldquo;And no one has ever
protected me, or wanted to do it, before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda took her in her arms&mdash;strong shapely arms they
were.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>&ldquo;Poor little soul!&rdquo; she whispered;
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see not only that I want you to stay here
but that for your own safety&rsquo;s sake you must stay here
until, at least, you know something of London, and have found
employment and made friends?&nbsp; When all that has happened,
you shall be free to choose as you think best, but till then
you&rsquo;re my prisoner, whether you like it or
not!&rdquo;&nbsp; After a little while Kitty said tremulously,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be offended, Hilda, but&mdash;but if only you
would allow me to&mdash;to pay my share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Miss Risk in a most business-like
tone, assumed mainly to satisfy the other, &ldquo;we may come to
terms later on&mdash;if you promise now to be my guest for a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew there was a girl like you in the
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more there is!&rdquo; said Hilda cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed I was such a coward till that
night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mislaid your courage&mdash;that was all&mdash;but
you&rsquo;ll find it again presently, and look here, Kitty!&nbsp;
Until my brother finds something for you to do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is he going to try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John never tries&mdash;at least he never seems to; he
just does.&nbsp; But never mind about that <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>now.&nbsp;
I was going to say that you can help me a bit, if you feel so
disposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&nbsp; Tell me quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used to type for your father, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&nbsp; I must show you the work I did for
him.&nbsp; I believe I was fairly smart, but after five years,
I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll knock off the rust in no time.&nbsp; You
can work away on my old machine most mornings, and when you feel
it coming easy I&rsquo;ll give you plenty of manuscript, my own
and other people&rsquo;s, too, if you want it.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the difference in the world, for it means I
shan&rsquo;t be entirely useless.&nbsp; Oh, you have made me so
happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; laughed Hilda.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like being
cuddled!&rdquo;&nbsp; But there were tears in her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed next moment,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s somebody coming up Jacob&rsquo;s
Ladder!&rdquo;&mdash;as she designated the steep and narrow
wooden staircase leading to the flat.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man, I
should say, from the tread.&nbsp; Shall we flee and tidy
ourselves, or simply draw down the sun blind?&rdquo;&nbsp; She
rose and went to the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be the blind,
I&rsquo;m afraid.&nbsp; Matilda is unusually alert in answering
the door to-day.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>Kitty.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no friends who aren&rsquo;t
nice, and I want you to meet them all sooner or later.&nbsp; Now
let&rsquo;s arrange ourselves at our ease, and hope it may be a
particularly nice one to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty was smiling despite her nervousness when the elderly
servant, whom Hilda&rsquo;s brother insisted on her retaining,
announced &ldquo;Mr. West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at once evident to Kitty that he and Hilda were the
best of friends.&nbsp; Next moment he was introduced to her, and
there was something in his handshake as well as in his eyes that
took away half her shyness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carstairs has come from Scotland to spend a little
time with me,&rdquo; Hilda said presently, &ldquo;so you must
give her as good an impression of the journalistic life as you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not in the trade, I hope, Miss
Carstairs?&rdquo; he said, with a faint smile; then,
suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;But pardon me, perhaps you are a friend of
Hugh Carstairs, of Glasgow, who wrote so brilliantly some years
ago.&nbsp; I met him once in a friend&rsquo;s house just before I
came to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was my father,&rdquo; Kitty said softly, with a
flush of pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you and I shall have at least one big subject in
common,&rdquo; he said warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is splendid!&rdquo; said Hilda, smiling.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;Mr. Carstairs was my ideal journalist,&rdquo;
Anthony went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered why he
never wrote books.&nbsp; Perhaps he hadn&rsquo;t the
time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carstairs has just been telling me,&rdquo; said
the hostess, &ldquo;that she has in her possession several
unfinished works of her father&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here? not in London?&rdquo; he cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kitty timidly, &ldquo;I have them with
me.&nbsp; There are several&mdash;one a play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be too much,&rdquo; Anthony began and
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. West means that he would like to read them,&rdquo;
Hilda remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you might trust him,&rdquo;
she added, with a glint of amusement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really,
Anthony, I never saw you so enthusiastic before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Hilda, until I give you some cuttings of Hugh
Carstairs&rsquo; articles to read.&nbsp; And you, Miss Carstairs,
perhaps, when you know me better, you will allow me to look at
the unfinished works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Matilda brought in tea, and the conversation
became less personal.&nbsp; Kitty was well content to
listen.&nbsp; She was more than interested.&nbsp; The five years
of barren drudgery in Dunford were forgotten.&nbsp; She was
living in a <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>new world, the world of her girlish dreams during the
last year of her father&rsquo;s life, the world he had promised
he would show her&mdash;some day&mdash;when his ship came home. .
. .&nbsp; And Hilda Risk, guessing what it meant to the girl,
kept West talking of people and things in his profession, till
with a start he noticed the hour, and rose to go.</p>
<p>Hilda went with him to the door.&nbsp; She had a question to
ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not like
you to gush.&nbsp; Did you really admire her father&rsquo;s work
so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, Hilda.&nbsp; Why, the man was a genius,
though I&rsquo;m afraid he didn&rsquo;t make the most of
himself.&nbsp; Possibly your brother has not mentioned that he
knew Carstairs well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John!&nbsp; He never told me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;John
requested me to call on you this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not annoyed, Hilda?&rdquo;, he asked
rather anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; she smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I
ought not to be surprised at this time of day at anything John
does.&nbsp; I suppose he wanted your impression of
Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>&ldquo;I think he wanted to be made absolutely certain
that she is the daughter of Hugh Carstairs.&nbsp; I was not to
make any other inquiries of her.&nbsp; But, as you know, there
isn&rsquo;t much profit in asking John his reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll leave it at that.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;ll not ask you what you think of
Kitty&mdash;yet.&nbsp; Come soon again and make her better
acquaintance.&nbsp; She is very sweet, and she will be bright,
too, once she gets a chance. . . .&nbsp; Working as hard as ever,
I suppose?&rdquo; she said, as he took her hand for a moment.</p>
<p>He smiled a little sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you allow me to
take you and Miss Carstairs to the theatre one night soon?&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; that will be a treat for us both,
Anthony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to introduce a friend of mine who has
just turned up in London&mdash;Colin Hayward.&nbsp; Your
brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, John mentioned him yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then may I bring him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till then, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda returned to the sitting-room to find a new Kitty, all
delight and eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me what he writes?&rdquo; she asked, <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>almost sure
that Mr. West was her friend&rsquo;s lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He writes beautiful things that don&rsquo;t
sell,&rdquo; Hilda replied a trifle bitterly, &ldquo;and he makes
a poor but decent living from a wretched provincial paper.&nbsp;
And,&rdquo; she continued with a change of tone, &ldquo;there
isn&rsquo;t a better man on this earth&mdash;nor a prouder.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m telling you this, Kitty, because you are likely to meet
him pretty often.&nbsp; He has refused a post worth &pound;1,500
a year offered him by my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because at Cromer, four years ago, he saved me from
drowning, and he refuses to be paid for that.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
pride for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it more than pride?&rdquo; Kitty softly
ventured.</p>
<p>Miss Risk passed to the window and drew up the blind,
remarking: &ldquo;He is going to take us to the theatre one night
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty clasped her hands in rapture.&nbsp; &ldquo;I seem to
have come into Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the way, he has a great
friend who hails from your part of the world, Kitty.&nbsp; Mr.
Colin Hayward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another villain, I hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not mind if Mr. West brought him
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; said Kitty, angry with herself for
blushing.&nbsp; It was so silly, especially as she was not in
love with Colin.</p>
<p>Hilda did not pursue the subject.&nbsp; Their friendship, she
felt, was still far too new for the taking of liberties, however
kindly.&nbsp; After a pause&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you decided,&rdquo; she inquired, &ldquo; about
letting your aunt know your address?&nbsp; I wish I could advise
you, but I simply don&rsquo;t know what to say about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait for another
day.&nbsp; If I could only let her know without my uncle learning
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t hurt you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; murmured Kitty, with another sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this won&rsquo;t do!&nbsp; Mustn&rsquo;t get into
the dumps again!&nbsp; Leave it till to-morrow, as you say.&nbsp;
How do you feel about a walk before dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love it!&nbsp; And please, Hilda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;Will you&mdash;will you help me to buy some
decent clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Miss Risk, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
proper spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matilda came in with a telegram for her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reply paid, Miss,&rdquo; she said retiring;
&ldquo;boy&rsquo;s waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda read the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Has your guest any recollection of hearing
her father use the word zenith not in an astronomical
sense?&mdash;John.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My brother asks an extraordinary question,&rdquo; said
Hilda, and handed the message to Kitty.</p>
<p>Kitty gazed at it, frowned and shook her head.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, wait!&nbsp; The answer to the question is
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; but once, quite recently, I heard my uncle
speak of Zeniths&mdash;not zenith.&nbsp; But why should Mr.
Risk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just reply,
&lsquo;Not father but uncle,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Hilda, going to
the writing-table.</p>
<p>And just then Matilda came in with another telegram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Hilda, and with her pencil
slit it open.&nbsp; Her gay expression faded <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>out.&nbsp;
She paled slightly, muttering, &ldquo;Another matter,&rdquo; and
tore it into little pieces.&nbsp; Then she went on with writing
the reply.</p>
<p>The torn telegram, which had been &ldquo;handed in&rdquo; at
the same hour as its precursor, was also from her brother.&nbsp;
It said&mdash;&ldquo;Take very good care of your guest.&nbsp; No
going out alone.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t alarm her.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">John Corrie</span> was now fairly in the
net.&nbsp; He reached his cottage in a condition verging on
collapse, physical and mental, and slinking round to the back,
gained admittance by the window of his own room, from which he
had emerged an age, as it seemed, ago.&nbsp; He stood listening.
. . .&nbsp; Not a sound.&nbsp; What was his sister doing?&nbsp;
He must see her at once&mdash;not to tell her anything, but to
discover whether she had learned of his having been out of
doors.</p>
<p>But first he must remove traces of the outing.&nbsp; Having
lit the candle, he got off his boots, and the black
muffler.&nbsp; They must be got rid of.</p>
<p>In stocking feet he stole to the shop, and there made a parcel
which he laid on a high shelf behind a row of tomato tins.&nbsp;
In another part of the shop he hid his jacket in similar
fashion.&nbsp; And then a most sickening thought struck him and
almost wrecked his fear-tossed mind.&nbsp; The
staff&mdash;Almighty! what on earth had made him fling <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>it in the
ditch?&nbsp; Sooner or later a search would be made; might even
be going on now!&nbsp; Presently, his mouth craving water, he
went unsteadily, spilling candle-grease by the way, to the
kitchen.</p>
<p>And there he found his sister, in a heap on the floor.&nbsp;
She was inert, but fully conscious.&nbsp; Somehow he managed to
drag her up and place her in the arm-chair by the cold
hearth.&nbsp; Then he got water, and gave her some, took a
draught himself, and sat down by the table.&nbsp; On a sudden
inspiration he blew out the candle.&nbsp; A wakeful, curious
person might wonder to see a light at such an hour.&nbsp; Besides
. . .</p>
<p>For perhaps twenty minutes the two wretched beings sat huddled
in their chairs, motionless, speechless, while a feeble greyness
began to filter slowly through the darkness.&nbsp; Then the woman
spoke, neither to the man nor herself, but as to a third person,
invisible, somewhere in the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he died quick. . . .&nbsp; I hope he didna feel
the fire. . . .&nbsp; I did it for my brother&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp;
I promised mother I would look after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie rose and sat down again.&nbsp; He was not going to tell
her that Sam had escaped the flames.</p>
<p>There was another silence, and through it came the sound of a
person running on the dry road.&nbsp; <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Presently the sound gave place to
that of knocking, then cries&mdash;shouts&mdash;more
knocking&mdash;then running again&mdash;several
persons&mdash;cries and shouts once more. . . .</p>
<p>Through the greyness the man and woman peered at each
other&rsquo;s pallid countenances.&nbsp; And she was thinking of
a little brother she had tended long, long ago; and he was
thinking of a clublike staff lying in a ditch.&nbsp; The
scattered noises from the village grew to a commotion.&nbsp;
Corrie dropped forward, his elbows on his knees, his face between
his hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly the woman got up and came over to him, and laid her
hand on his shoulder, and said with a strange
tenderness&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna be feared, John.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re safe.&nbsp;
The letter&rsquo;s bound to be ashes by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she shrieked, for the room was lit by a blinding flash,
and she fell to her knees.&nbsp; Almost immediately the house
shook under an appalling crash.&nbsp; The long threatened storm
had burst at last.</p>
<p>There was a pause as though to allow Earth to take one long
breath before the storm and deluge&mdash;which were to prove
memorable in Dunford and district.</p>
<p>Not many minutes had passed when something <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>like hope
came to John Corrie.&nbsp; Unless the staff were already
discovered, he was safe so far as it was concerned, for now the
ditch would be rushing a foot deep.&nbsp; His wits began to work
again.&nbsp; Even if young Hayward had picked up the letter. . .
.</p>
<p>He drew Rachel to her feet, saying shortly but not harshly:
&ldquo;Get to your bed, woman.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m for
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo; she echoed faintly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would ye
face the wrath o&rsquo; God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would face the folk, in case they wonder.&nbsp;
Besides, ye canna be sure that&mdash;that he&rsquo;s burnt
wi&rsquo; the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; she whispered; and a moment
later&mdash;&ldquo;John, bring me word he&rsquo;s alive, and
I&rsquo;ll take oath it was me that stole the
Zeniths!&rdquo;&nbsp; She moved gropingly from the room.</p>
<p>So Corrie, having put on his Sunday boots and oilskins, went
out into the storm to face his fellows.&nbsp; He did not
encounter his poor victim, who was already on the way, in a
summer visitor&rsquo;s motor-car, to the nearest hospital, twenty
miles distant; but he heard talk of concussion of the brain and a
villainous-looking tramp seen in the village the previous night;
also he beheld the ruins of the shanty and the brimming
ditch.&nbsp; <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>But for something white on the sodden grass he looked
in vain; and young Hayward, it seemed, had disappeared after
doing what he could for the postman.</p>
<p>It was nearing four when Corrie returned home.&nbsp; The storm
had ceased, though fine rain still fell on torn-up roads, ruined
crops and flooded meadows.&nbsp; He told Rachel exactly what he
had heard, and added a little more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was found by young Hayward.&nbsp; Supposing he had
the letter in his hand when he was struck, where is it
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was too exhausted by the revulsion, too thankful, to think
it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in danger, John, I&rsquo;ll take the
blame,&rdquo; she faltered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope the
letter was burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s not burned, what about
Symington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He mun give back the shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye talk foolishness, Rachel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearied.&nbsp; I canna grasp aught except
that I didna commit black murder.&nbsp; Let me be till the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afraid to say more lest he should betray himself, he let her
go.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock, the moment the wire was open, he sent
a telegram to Symington&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;Come at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About eleven, Symington&rsquo;s housekeeper, purchasing
provisions, mentioned in the course of her chatter on last
night&rsquo;s affair&mdash;the sole topic of conversation in
Dunford&mdash;that young Mr. Hayward had called to see her
employer at six o&rsquo;clock that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he wanting at such an hour?&rdquo; Corrie
managed to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didna name his business, but he took a note o&rsquo;
the address in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This added to Corrie&rsquo;s uneasiness, though he could
conceive of no connexion between the early call and the
letter.</p>
<p>About an hour later, a customer casually referred to his
having observed young Hayward enter the morning train for the
South, at Kenny Junction.&nbsp; At that Corrie wellnigh gave
up.&nbsp; All morning he had hoped against hope that Hayward
would return the letter to its owner&mdash;himself.&nbsp; Now he
was forced to face two dreadful possibilities: first, that
Hayward had recognized him last night; secondly, that Hayward
knew Kitty&rsquo;s address in London.&nbsp; And before long he
perceived a third: namely, that Symington, elated by the enormous
rise in Zeniths, might have been talking openly about his
shares.&nbsp; Corrie felt <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>like making a bolt for it.&nbsp;
Vain to imagine mercy from Kitty after all that had passed!&nbsp;
Only the idea that Hayward&rsquo;s recognition would be a
difficult thing to substantiate and the thought of his
sister&rsquo;s promise restrained and sustained him.</p>
<p>He called Rachel into the post office at a moment when no
business was doing.&nbsp; They had scarcely spoken since three
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye stand by what ye said about the&mdash;the
shares?&rdquo; he asked her, not without shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye; I&rsquo;ve promised,&rdquo; she answered
dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be easier on a woman than a man,&rdquo; he
observed, looking away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesna matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned to go back to
the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Symington&rsquo;ll be here to-night,&rdquo; he
pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;There ought to ha&rsquo; been a letter from
him this morning, so I wired him.&nbsp; Maybe we&rsquo;ll manage
to put everything right yet.&nbsp; I wish we had your
niece&rsquo;s address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She faced him.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had it, I wouldna tell
ye,&rdquo; she said quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be enough
if I ha&rsquo; to sacrifice myself.&nbsp; Speak no more to me
about this business, John Corrie, for I ha&rsquo; nothing more to
say.&nbsp; Only terrible thoughts.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that she
left him.</p>

136</span>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Colin Hayward</span> began the journey
south with much to wonder about.&nbsp; He had obtained no light
whatever on the extraordinary affair in front of the burning
house, for Sam had not recovered consciousness.&nbsp; It was,
indeed, doubtful whether he would ever do so.&nbsp; Colin had not
the slightest suspicion as to the identity of the muffled coward
whom he had seen fell the half-suffocated postman; he had not,
owing to position, observed the former take anything from the
latter&rsquo;s helpless hand; neither had he in his rage noticed
the crushed letter fall.&nbsp; It was in his path as he turned to
the victim&rsquo;s succour, and he had picked it up almost
automatically, with some vague notion that it might be of
consequence to somebody or other.</p>
<p>Then he had forgotten about it.</p>
<p>Now&mdash;an hour after leaving the junction&mdash;having
exhausted the contents of his cigarette case, he put his hand
into a pocket for a reserve <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>packet, and encountered the
document.&nbsp; He merely glanced at its heading, intending to
place it in his letter-case for attention later.&nbsp; He had no
intention of reading it through.&nbsp; Enough to learn to whom it
belonged.&nbsp; But the words &ldquo;My dear Corrie&rdquo;
arrested both hand and eye.&nbsp; Presently he told himself that
there was nothing so very strange in this; the letter might
easily have been dropped and left lying there hours before the
ghastly affair took place.&nbsp; He noticed the date was of more
than five years back.&nbsp; But in the same moment he was caught
by the words &ldquo;Kitty&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Zeniths&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;5,000 shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to read this whether I like it or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a longish letter, written in a clear small hand on both
sides of a large square sheet.&nbsp; The portion with which we
are concerned was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You may perhaps find nothing in the
enclosed share certificates (which, please note, are
&lsquo;bearer&rsquo;) but a fresh evidence of my folly in worldly
matters.&nbsp; Still, the Zenith Gold Mine is the only thing of
the kind I ever put hard-earned money into.&nbsp; There are 5,000
&pound;1 shares, and I paid 2s. apiece for them, and at the
moment they are unsaleable.&nbsp; I acted on the advice of a
friend <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>who had seen the property, and who had knowledge of
such things.&nbsp; He was convinced that the mine would come
right in time&mdash;meaning years&mdash;and pay big
dividends.&nbsp; Well, he may have been all wrong, and I the
silliest of poor fools; but now, John, I put the shares in your
keeping as a &lsquo;possibility&rsquo; for Kitty, when she comes
of age.&nbsp; I have never mentioned them to her&mdash;certainly
not with any reference to herself&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t want
her to be more disappointed in me than I can help.&nbsp; Give
them to her when she is twenty-one, and show her this letter, and
if by any chance they are worth money then, or later, she will at
least repay you what she may have cost you&mdash;though, of
course, I am hoping she will earn enough to do that as she goes
along.</p>
<p><i>N.B.</i>&nbsp; Should you hear of the shares rising before
then, you will just use your discretion, and do the best you can
for my girl.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colin&rsquo;s delight at the thought of Kitty having a fortune
of her own was soon swamped by a flood of doubts and
suspicions.&nbsp; The remainder of the journey was a sort of
nightmare.&nbsp; Of only one thing could he assure himself as he
neared London: Kitty&rsquo;s fortune, were it in danger from
persons in London or Dunford, was not going to <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>be made an
easier prey by any act of his.&nbsp; At first he had thought of
showing the letter to Mr. Risk and asking his advice, but now he
determined that his only course was to return to Dunford at the
earliest possible moment, and put it into the hands of Kitty
herself.&nbsp; He might be losing the chance of his life by such
an action, and Mr. Risk might be the best and straightest of men,
but Colin was so truly in love with the girl that the
hopelessness of it made no difference.&nbsp; Consequently nothing
but her happiness mattered.</p>
<p>It was about five o&rsquo;clock when he reached Aberdare
Mansions.&nbsp; He was admitted without delay to his
employer&rsquo;s study.&nbsp; Before he could speak, Mr. Risk,
with a smile, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I gave you that vain journey, Hayward.&nbsp; This
morning a note from Symington came to the office requesting that
the new certificates should be delivered to him at the Kingsway
<i>Grand Hotel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s the address his housekeeper gave me,
Mr. Risk,&rdquo; said Colin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you wish me to take
the letter there now?&rdquo; he inquired, producing it.</p>
<p>Risk took it and laid it on the writing-table, saying:
&ldquo;About noon I sent the secretary to the hotel with a
similar letter, and he found that <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Mr. Symington had left for Scotland
about two hours previously&mdash;presumably in response to a wire
which the secretary was able to learn he had received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone back to Dunford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not assume that.&nbsp; Take a cigarette,
Hayward, and, if agreeable to you, tell me in a few words what
you know of Mr. Symington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, Mr. Risk, and any information I have is
indirect.&nbsp; His father and his two brothers all died within a
year, and about eighteen months ago he became the owner of what
we call the White Farm&mdash;a very decent little place until he
got possession.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not interested in farming, you
know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard he has done all sorts of
things&mdash;some pretty queer&mdash;in his time.&nbsp; He has
the reputation of being a gambler, and a speculator, but please
remember that I&rsquo;m repeating gossip.&nbsp;
I&rdquo;&mdash;Colin hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;I really know nothing
against the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk, offering a lighted match, said quietly: &ldquo;Well,
what do you know in his favour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;One is more likely to hear of a
man&rsquo;s faults than his virtues.&nbsp; Besides, as I told
you, I&rsquo;ve been more away from Dunford than in it during the
last five years or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not familiar with the natives?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;Not generally speaking.&nbsp; Still, I hope I
have a friend or two among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would Mr. Symington have been welcome in your
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father would have been courteously
received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk nodded thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please pardon so many
questions, Hayward.&nbsp; I feel that I may now tell you why I am
taking so much trouble, and giving you so much, over this Mr.
Symington.&nbsp; About seven years ago I advised a friend who had
come into a little money to put it into Zeniths for what is
sometimes termed a &lsquo;long shot.&rsquo;&nbsp; I did so not
only because I positively knew the mines had a great future,
though possibly a distant one, but also because I knew my friend
would otherwise fritter away the money which he honestly believed
he could save for his daughter, then a young girl. . . .&nbsp;
Yes, Hayward?&nbsp; Have you something to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go on,&rdquo; said Colin, restraining
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Zeniths at that period,&rdquo; the
other proceeded, &ldquo;were decidedly out of favour.&nbsp; One
could buy at two or three shillings.&nbsp; My friend bought 5,000
at half a crown a share.&nbsp; At his request I did the business
for him and eventually handed him ten bearer certificates for 500
shares <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>each.&nbsp; I am a methodical person in some respects,
and in an old diary I have a record of the transaction and the
numbers of the shares.&nbsp; Now&mdash;one moment,
please!&mdash;I had my friend&rsquo;s promise that he would not
part with the shares until I gave him the word.&nbsp; If he
needed money badly, he was to let me know.&nbsp; Time passed, and
circumstances prevented our meeting; I was much abroad.&nbsp; I
did not hear of his death until a year afterwards, and I failed
to trace his daughter.&nbsp; But I have always been on the watch
for shares bearing the numbers recorded in the old diary, and I
have not grown less keen since the shares began to move up in
earnest.&nbsp; And now, when the shares have risen to over four
pounds apiece&mdash;when my friend, had he lived, would have seen
himself worth at least twenty thousand pounds&mdash;along comes a
letter from a Mr. Symington covering five hundred of those same
shares&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Risk, I have something to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment more!&mdash;and within a few hours of its
receipt I discover, by the merest chance, the daughter of my old
friend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her&mdash;his name was Carstairs&mdash;Hugh
Carstairs?&rdquo; exploded Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no doubt you mean as well by the <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>daughter as
you meant by the father?&mdash;Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr.
Risk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Risk frowned, then he smiled pleasantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The daughter has never seen me, but she has no better
friend for her father&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Yet I must try to
satisfy you that I am not interested in those 5,000 shares with
an eye to personal profit.&rdquo;&nbsp; He got up and, leaving
Colin hot and uncomfortable, went to a safe built into the wall
behind the panelling, a door in which stood open.&nbsp; He came
back with a thin bundle of parchment-like papers which he put
into the young man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly look at these, Hayward, and tell me what they
represent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly but perforce Colin examined the documents and
after a little while replied a trifle huskily&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty thousand shares in the Zenith Company&mdash;and
you are the owner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, does that satisfy you that I can afford to be
honest?&nbsp; Please don&rsquo;t think I was showing
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin hung his head as he handed back the
certificates&mdash;and murmured an apology.&nbsp; He was not so
much impressed by the man&rsquo;s great wealth as by his cool,
straightforward answer to suspicion.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;You are evidently Miss Carstairs&rsquo; good
friend,&rdquo; Risk said kindly, throwing the bundle on the
table, &ldquo;and so your doubts do you credit.&nbsp; You are
aware that she is in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin jumped.&nbsp; Well, she had not been long in making use
of the hundred pounds!&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
he managed to say fairly steadily, and could have asked many
questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is staying with my sister,&rdquo; continued
Risk.&nbsp; &ldquo;My sister was here a few minutes ago.&nbsp;
Sorry you did not meet.&nbsp; If you like, we shall call upon her
after dinner.&nbsp; But now as to Symington, I&rsquo;m afraid I
shall have to ask you to make another night journey; only you
need not start till 11.30, when you will find a sleeping berth on
the train.&nbsp; Am I working you too hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather not!&rdquo; cried Colin.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, Mr.
Risk, I must not delay another moment to show you
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; He produced the crumpled letter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When you have read it, I will answer any questions I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk took the letter and started slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh&rsquo;s writing!&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp; He read
carefully and without apparent emotion.&nbsp; Having come to the
end, he sighed and said softly: &ldquo;Just tell me all you can,
Hayward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin made a brief and simple relation of his <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>experience
beside the burning house.&nbsp; He also told what he knew of the
Corries.&nbsp; His host heard him out in silence&mdash;and
thereafter remained in thought for a space.</p>
<p>Then he said: &ldquo;You have raised a lot of questions,
Hayward, but I must try to put them in order before I ask
them.&nbsp; Certainly we shall have enough to talk about this
evening, and I&rsquo;m afraid we must postpone the call upon my
sister.&nbsp; In any case I don&rsquo;t think we ought to bring
Miss Carstairs into the business before we cannot avoid doing
so.&nbsp; I have learned that she has no knowledge of the
purchase of Zeniths by her father.&nbsp; It would be a pity to
excite or alarm her unnecessarily.&nbsp; At the same time, this
letter of Corrie&rsquo;s in itself proves nothing against the
man.&nbsp; I am not in Miss Carstairs&rsquo; confidence, and my
sister has not felt at liberty so far to tell me what the girl
has confided to her; but I can&rsquo;t help suspecting, after
what you have told me, that Miss Carstairs was not particularly
happy in Dunford, and that she may possibly have run
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said Colin almost
inaudibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;I am loth to
believe that she had so little common sense to attempt London
with nothing in her purse and <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>no friends in view&mdash;for you
have given me to understand that such was her position.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo; he asked, with a keen glance at his
guest.</p>
<p>Colin felt himself reddening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Risk said pleasantly,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t you help me by being open with me?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m the older man, and I&rsquo;ve been pretty frank with
you.&nbsp; The fuller the confidence between us, the better we
shall work together.&nbsp; Now I do not doubt for a moment that
you were honestly surprised to hear of Miss Carstairs being in
London&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon,&rdquo; added Colin, before he could prevent
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Risk,&rdquo; cried the young man, half-angry,
half-amused, &ldquo;you would get the truth out of any one!&nbsp;
Well, I&rsquo;ll trust you; but she must never know.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he confessed to sending Kitty the hundred pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much had you for your own needs when you
arrived in London?&rdquo; was the first question from Risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen odds.&nbsp; But, you know, I couldn&rsquo;t
have taken the money for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The host&rsquo;s smile was kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I doubt
whether you are going to be a great worldly success, <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Hayward,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure you
are on the right road to happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin gave his head a rueful shake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please
understand,&rdquo; he said shyly, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s
nothing between Miss Carstairs and me except a little ordinary
friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for telling me about the money,&rdquo; said
Risk, in a more business-like tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now as to this
letter, what is your suggestion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you keep it&mdash;in your safe&mdash;for the
present, Mr. Risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight frown contracted the older man&rsquo;s brow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a horrible thing,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;to be
retaining another man&rsquo;s property, and yet I think the
circumstances will excuse, though I still hope they may not
justify, the action.&nbsp; You see, if Mr. Corrie is innocent, we
are doing him a great wrong; if he is guilty&mdash;well, we are
depriving him of a rope to hang himself with.&nbsp; On the whole,
I think you ought to call on him to-morrow morning and hand him
back the letter&mdash;which I shall keep until it is time for you
to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Colin, aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you need not trouble about Mr. Symington for the
present.&nbsp; Let us assume them both innocent until we can
prove them guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Kit&mdash;Miss Carstairs&rsquo; fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>&ldquo;Say the word, and I will hand over to you 5,000
of my own shares to hold until you are satisfied that I am
dealing fairly with her interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hoped you were going to trust me,&rdquo; the
other murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Risk,&rdquo; cried the young man distractedly,
&ldquo;put yourself in my place!&nbsp; What would you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d at least think over it,&rdquo; Risk replied
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you half an hour.&nbsp;
I have an engagement now&mdash;with a photographer, of all
people&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sure you would like a bath and a
change of linen after those journeyings.&nbsp; My man will look
after you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pressed a bell-button on the
table.&nbsp; &ldquo;And while you are thinking over it, please
keep remembering this: that there is only one right way of doing
a thing&mdash;which is my way!&rdquo;&nbsp; He laughed and
extended his hand.&nbsp; Then he became grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hugh
Carstairs once rendered a great service to my mother when she was
abroad and alone.&nbsp; He is dead, but I remember always.&nbsp;
And if any man tries to rob Hugh Carstairs&rsquo; daughter, and
cheat Hugh in his grave&mdash;then God help that man!&nbsp; He
shall not escape me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>The
servant opened the door and stood at attention.&nbsp; Knowing not
what to think, Colin rose and passed out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>At the same hour Hilda Risk was ascending to her flat in Long
Acre.&nbsp; On the second landing she came to an abrupt
stop.&nbsp; She had walked from her brother&rsquo;s home,
intending to make a purchase on the way&mdash;and had forgotten
all about it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Trying to think of too many things at
once,&rdquo; she reprimanded herself, and retraced her steps.</p>
<p>As she emerged upon the street she almost collided with a man
apparently about to enter.&nbsp; He drew back with a muttered
apology, and she passed on her way with a vague feeling of having
seen him before.&nbsp; He had a sharp, rather pinched
countenance, small dark moustache, and his bowler hat was
decidedly shabby.&nbsp; So much she noticed.&nbsp; Then she
dismissed the matter, proceeded on her errand, returned home to
find Kitty happy at the typewriter, but happier still to see her,
and settled down to some journalistic work which was to keep her
busy most of the evening.&nbsp; As for the man, he made for
Covent Garden telegraph office.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, being wakeful, she had an odd
recollection of the pinched face under <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>the shabby
bowler.&nbsp; And now she remembered where she had seen the man
before.&nbsp; Why, only half an hour had elapsed between the
first and second encounter!&nbsp; For she had noticed him on the
opposite pavement as she was leaving Aberdare Mansions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beast followed me!&rdquo; she thought suddenly.</p>
<h2><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">You</span> bungler!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Symington&rsquo;s countenance was sickly; his voice was
full of cold and bitter disgust.</p>
<p>The wretched Corrie had come to the end of his sorry
confession, not without interruptions mainly of an angry, abusive
nature.&nbsp; And now the verdict&mdash;&ldquo;You
bungler!&rdquo;&nbsp; Somehow it stung most of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to call names,&rdquo; he rejoined
resentfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; the only
bungler.&nbsp; If ever a man let a girl slip through his fingers
it was you.&nbsp; Ye should ha&rsquo; had her easy that
night&mdash;while she was terrified&mdash;after she had taken the
post office money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she took any
money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how could she pay her fare to London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the postman lent&mdash;gave&mdash;her
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postmaster forced a grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, ye can <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>believe
that if ye like.&nbsp; And then,&rdquo; he went on quickly,
&ldquo;ye had your chance in the train&mdash;and lost
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if ye had got the girl, the letter wouldna
ha&rsquo; mattered so much, for ye would ha&rsquo; got the
Zeniths wi&rsquo; her.&nbsp; So ye can blame yourself as well as
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence.&nbsp; Corrie sat glowering at the floor
and plucking at his lower lip.&nbsp; Symington scowled openly at
him.&nbsp; They were in the privacy of the parlour.&nbsp; It was
about nine o&rsquo;clock and growing dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly Symington emitted a short, ugly laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So this is what you brought me back from London for!&nbsp;
Well, I don&rsquo;t wonder at your being afraid.&nbsp; Between
embezzlement and attempted murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisht, man, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be murder itself yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, damn ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Corrie; what&rsquo;ll you do if Sam
recovers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He canna recover&mdash;I heard it an hour before ye
arrived.&nbsp; But supposing he does recover, what can he do
without the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly sure he didn&rsquo;t spot
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;Aye; I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;and I&rsquo;m almost
sure young Hayward didna&rsquo; recognize me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otherwise you wouldna be sitting here
now&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that pass,&rdquo; said Corrie, restraining his
temper.&nbsp; &ldquo;The point is&mdash;the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t happen to be interested in the
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve got to be interested in it!&nbsp; If I
canna get back the letter, I&rsquo;ll need to get back the
shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t get back the
shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie exploded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would ye ruin me&mdash;send me
to the jail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington ignored the outburst.&nbsp; &ldquo;I bought the
shares from you,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;and paid for
them.&nbsp; I have your acknowledgment.&nbsp; I may say that I
intend to hold them till September, when a first dividend will be
declared, which, I am informed, will send them to ten
pounds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten pound!&nbsp; Fifty thousand for the lot!&rdquo;
gasped Corrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&nbsp; But rather than risk being involved in
your dirty affairs, I&rsquo;ll sell the lot to-morrow for what I
can get and&mdash;er&mdash;emigrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye swine!&mdash;but ye&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; the police
after ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>Corrie rose, sat down again, and writhed in his
impotence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have the lawyers after me,&rdquo; Symington
admitted easily, &ldquo;but the lawyers always take a
&mdash;&mdash; of a time to get to work, and I generally travel
quickly.&nbsp; However, I think you&rsquo;re making too much of
your own danger.&nbsp; Kitty is not likely to attempt to
prosecute you, since you can prove that she tampered with the
post office money.&rdquo;&nbsp; He peered through the dusk at the
other&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Corrie managed to
reply.&nbsp; He was caught in the toils of his own making.</p>
<p>After a little while Symington said: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you make Kitty come back here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie started, then dropped his gaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can I
do that when I dinna ken where she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington took out the telegram he had found on his
arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that her address?&rdquo; cried the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be.&nbsp; It is certainly the address of the
lady who took charge of her on the train, and now that I&rsquo;ve
got it, I&rsquo;ll soon find where Kitty is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did ye get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind.&nbsp; But it might be worth your while to
send a wire, first thing in the morning <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>to Kitty,
at this address.&nbsp; Just say: &lsquo;Serious for you if not
home within twenty-four hours&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; How&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie groaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;She wouldna come. . . .&nbsp;
Maybe she&rsquo;s seen the letter by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she hasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a chance
anyway&mdash;your only chance, perhaps.&nbsp; Will you
wire&mdash;put it stronger if you like&mdash;in the
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I tell ye, she wouldna come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington got to his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he
said slowly, &ldquo;it was a filthy lie about the post office
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie shrank in his chair.&nbsp; He was at the end of his
endurance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did it,&rdquo; he stammered &ldquo;to
help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&mdash;put the five-pun&rsquo; note in her
drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God damn you!&rdquo; cried Symington, raising his
fist.&nbsp; &ldquo;You did it to help yourself to half
the&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped short with a stifled
curse.</p>
<p>Miss Corrie came in with a lighted lamp, which she set on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye quarrelling?&rdquo; she quavered.&nbsp; She
seemed to have grown ten years older during the past forty-eight
hours.</p>
<p>Symington strode by her, but halted in the doorway.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to London to-morrow,&rdquo;
he said harshly, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want any more wires
from you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he went out.</p>
<p>Rachel turned to her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, John,&rdquo; she cried piteously, &ldquo;will he
no&rsquo; help ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unhappy man threw out his arms, let them fall on the edge
of the table and bowed his face on them.&nbsp; Helplessly his
sister regarded him, then turned and left him to himself.&nbsp;
She went to her room and fell on her knees.&nbsp; Had Kitty
appeared in that hour, one may presume that she would have been
offered the miserable confession of a miserable sinner.&nbsp; But
there is an old saying concerning the devil when he was sick. . .

<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Shortly, after eight the following morning, Colin, carrying a
light overcoat and a small suitcase, entered the post
office.&nbsp; The dingy place was flooded with sunlight; even the
passage to the shop was filled with it.&nbsp; The counter was
unattended.&nbsp; Upon it Colin laid the suitcase and coat.&nbsp;
Raising the lid he disclosed among sundry articles pertaining to
a lengthy night journey a little box camera.&nbsp; For a moment
or two he fingered it somewhat nervously.&nbsp; Then <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>at the
back&mdash;i.e., the bottom&mdash;of the case he drew aside a
strip of leather, uncovering a small round hole against which he
fitted the eye of the camera.&nbsp; He let down the lid so far:
it was kept from closing by his left hand which remained
inside.&nbsp; Presently, drawing a long breath, he rapped smartly
on the counter.</p>
<p>Almost immediately Miss Corrie appeared in the short
passage.&nbsp; At the sight of him she seemed to stumble, and as
she recovered herself he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I see Mr. Corrie for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without answering she turned and went back.&nbsp; It seemed
many minutes before Corrie himself appeared.&nbsp; Colin thought
he had never seen a more ghastly-looking creature.&nbsp; The
countenance was unreadable, but the man&rsquo;s soul was torn
between terror and hope.</p>
<p>As he stepped into the office there was a scarcely audible
click from the suit-case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he said huskily, and ran his tongue
over his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, Mr. Corrie,&rdquo; replied Colin, fairly
cheerfully.&nbsp; He raised the lid and brought forth a sealed
envelope without superscription.&nbsp; He handed it over the
counter, saying, &ldquo;You might look and see if the paper
enclosed belongs to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>Corrie took it with shaking fingers and moved back from
the counter.&nbsp; He cleared his throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye mean me
to open it, Mr. Hayward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Colin could have pitied the man as he
turned a second film silently into position.</p>
<p>The envelope was very firmly gummed, and Corrie&rsquo;s
fingers fumbled in a fashion painful to witness.&nbsp; But at
last it was torn open&mdash;the precious letter was in his
hand.&nbsp; He looked as if he were going to cry.&nbsp; Now the
click might have been ten times louder without his hearing
it.&nbsp; He was dazed with relief.</p>
<p>Colin closed the case, feeling almost guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it yours, Mr. Corrie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie seemed to pull himself together.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye,
it&rsquo;s mine, sure enough, and&mdash;and I&rsquo;m obliged to
ye, Mr. Hayward.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old cunning came to his
aid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I lost it more&rsquo;n a week ago.&nbsp; Might
I ask where ye found it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the grass across the road from the postman&rsquo;s
house, while it was burning,&rdquo; answered Colin, as naturally
as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s mysterious, for
it&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n a month since I was that road, except the
morning after the fire.&nbsp; Somebody mun ha&rsquo; found it and
lost it again.&nbsp; Well, once more, I&rsquo;m obliged <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>to ye,
though the paper&rsquo;s no&rsquo; o&rsquo; any great
consequence.&nbsp; It was written by my poor brother-in-law when
he wasna quite right in his head.&nbsp; Still, I&rsquo;m glad to
have it, Mr. Hayward, thank ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should explain,&rdquo; said Colin, concealing with an
effort his disgust, &ldquo;that after I picked it up I forgot
about it until I was in the train for London.&nbsp; Good morning,
Mr. Corrie.&rdquo;&nbsp; He caught up case and coat, and hurried
out before Corrie could frame another sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rachel!&mdash;here, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came in haste, almost weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John, John, ha&rsquo; ye got it back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he answered shortly, with something of his
old truculence of tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God be thanked!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to manage by yourself for an
hour,&rdquo; he said rapidly, &ldquo;I mun hurry to White
Farm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, John, ye&rsquo;ll tell Kitty the truth,&rdquo;
she cried excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I got her address this
morning.&nbsp; I can trust ye wi&rsquo; it now, for ye&rsquo;re a
changed man, as I&rsquo;m a changed woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;366 Long Acre, London&mdash;care o&rsquo; Miss
Risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mind it.&nbsp; Well, I mun run, or
I&rsquo;ll miss <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>Symington. I&rsquo;ll master him yet&mdash;aye, I will
that, by God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll tell Kitty the truth,
John&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll write to her this very day&mdash;will ye
no&rsquo;?&rdquo; she caught his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; he shook her off.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me gang,
woman!&nbsp; Well, well. I&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone&mdash;&ldquo;God!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is he
no&rsquo; a changed man after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington was at breakfast when Corrie broke in upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you want?&rdquo; was the spurious
farmer&rsquo;s greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got back the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and don&rsquo;t make a scene,&rdquo; said
Symington, after a moment. &ldquo;Tell me about it quietly. And
look here, Corrie; I was a bit rough on you last
night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye were that! But now it&rsquo;s my
turn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment. I had good cause for my annoyance&mdash;you
must admit that much.&nbsp; But after I left you, I thought it
over in cold blood, and came to the only conclusion
possible.&nbsp; You and I must continue to work together; we must
stick to the original bargain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll mean that ye&rsquo;ll try to marry her yet
and pay me half the profits&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;Exactly!&nbsp; Now tell me about the
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under this coolness Corrie&rsquo;s violence collapsed.&nbsp;
He seated himself, saying: &ldquo;But can I trust ye to keep
a&rsquo; I said last night secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got to trust each other, Corrie.&nbsp; Let us
forget about last night. . . .&nbsp; Now go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the end of the postmaster&rsquo;s brief recital
Symington&rsquo;s brows were contracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a puzzler,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should say that Hayward returned the letter for one of
two reasons: either he hadn&rsquo;t read it through, or else he
wants to stand well with you on account of Kitty. What do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to
think, but &rsquo;twill do neither of us good if he comes across
her in London&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know he&rsquo;s going back there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I canna&rsquo; say for certain, but I&rsquo;ve heard
o&rsquo; talk among the servants that there was trouble with his
father the other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possible,&rdquo; Symington grinned and became
grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s he doing back
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye beat me there.&nbsp; But if ye want advice,
it&rsquo;s just this: get a hold o&rsquo; the girl without
delay.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the only way now to make absolute sure
<a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>o&rsquo;
the Zeniths. I can give ye her address for certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m hanged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister got it this morning.&nbsp; Write it down,
will ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I thought,&rdquo; said Symington, a
moment later, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m obliged to you, Corrie.&nbsp;
And, as you say, it&rsquo;s the only way to make sure of the
Zeniths without risking trouble.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go south
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are ye going to get a hold o&rsquo; her?&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;ve got to mind she&rsquo;s wi&rsquo; friends&mdash;at
least I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can leave that to me.&nbsp; Kitty won&rsquo;t
escape me a third time!&nbsp; I wonder if she&rsquo;s much in
love with that fellow Hayward.&nbsp; Well, if she is, I&rsquo;ll
make use of the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give something to ha&rsquo; him out o&rsquo;
the road,&rdquo; said Corrie, with sudden viciousness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; he maybe kens more&rsquo;n
he&rsquo;s shown.&nbsp; If Sam was to get better after
a&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start brooding on that!&rdquo; said
Symington shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the way, have you destroyed
the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to keep it&mdash;safely this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on earth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie glared at his fellow-conspirator. &ldquo;I <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>intend to
trust ye, Symington,&rdquo; he said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Same
time, I warn ye, if ye try to get the better o&rsquo; me,
I&rsquo;ll take the risk o&rsquo; handing the letter to Kitty
Carstairs and telling her the whole cursed story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Symington&rsquo;s gaze was murderous.&nbsp;
Then he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Canny man, canny man!&rdquo; he
sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Kitty would forgive you&mdash;well, let
that pass.&nbsp; Meantime, I want the loan of twenty
pounds.&nbsp; There ought to have been a registered letter for me
this morning.&nbsp; If it comes to-morrow, you must re-direct it
to London.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll walk down to the shop with you
and get the cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Corrie reluctantly, after a
pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;But ye mun be careful what ye say before
Rachel.&nbsp; I doubt if she&rsquo;s on our side now.&nbsp; Let
her think ye&rsquo;re considering about giving me back the
Zeniths for the girl.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Now that she&rsquo;s got Kitty&rsquo;s
address she might easily make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Corrie, as they went down the road,
&ldquo;I wish ye would tell me how ye&rsquo;re going to get a
hold o&rsquo; her.&nbsp; Ha&rsquo; ye got a plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have.&rdquo; Symington smiled darkly, and
changed the subject.</p>

<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Meanwhile Colin was seated in an exceedingly slow train
on his way to the hospital where Sam the postman lay.</p>
<p>Afterwards he would go on to Glasgow, and thence hack to
London by a line that did not pass near Dunford. In this he was
simply obeying the instructions of Mr. Risk.</p>
<h2><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> nearly a fortnight should have
passed without any effort on Symington&rsquo;s part to &ldquo;get
a hold&rdquo; of Kitty may seem to the reader to require some
explanation.&nbsp; Possibly sufficient will be found in a
conversation between Risk and Colin, which took place on the
twelfth day after the latter&rsquo;s call on the postmaster of
Dunford.&nbsp; Colin had returned from Scotland, only to be
dispatched, within a few hours, to an address in Amsterdam with a
belt full of finely broken bottle glass next his skin, which he
believed to be a fortune in uncut precious stones.&nbsp; Back
from Holland he found written mstructions to proceed to Madrid to
fetch a little box purporting to contain 3,000 sovereigns, and
actually concealing about half a hundredweight of lead.</p>
<p>And now, a trifle fagged, he was sitting in Risk&rsquo;s
study, hoping to hear that he had done well.&nbsp; Risk did not
keep him long in suspense.&nbsp; <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>After a few questions respecting the
last journey he said, rather abruptly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Hayward, you&rsquo;ve been serving me so far
pretty much with your eyes shut: I wonder if you care to continue
with your eyes open.&nbsp; I warn you that some of the work may
be dull and most of it will be hard.&nbsp; I have got plenty of
young men who work well in their own particular grooves, but I
want one who is prepared to take on any job I put before him,
just as I, with so many different interests, have had to do in
the past for myself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t expect you to learn
everything at once, but I should expect you to be interested in
everything that interests me.&nbsp; And I offer you &pound;500
for the first year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin almost leapt from his seat.&nbsp; &ldquo;&pound;500, Mr.
Risk!&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll never be worth that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think differently six months hence.&nbsp;
Meantime, do you accept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rather!&mdash;and thank you a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s talk of something else.&nbsp; For
instance, I have word that your friend the postman has a chance
of recovering, and I have to tell you about our friend
Symington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering,&rdquo; said Colin,
&ldquo;whether he accepted your invitation to call at the
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did&mdash;the morning after you left for <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>Amsterdam.&nbsp; Incidentally, I got rather a good
snap-shot of him.&nbsp; He seemed a trifle nervous until he
received the new certificates, and then he coolly informed the
secretary that he had purchased the old ones six years
ago&mdash;an unmitigated lie, as we know.&nbsp; It remains to be
seen, of course, whether he is acting for himself or for Corrie,
and if the former, how many of the 5,000 shares have come into
his possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prevent him selling the
shares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could do that by circularizing all the exchanges and
brokers, but sooner or later that would mean publicity.&nbsp;
Besides, I want to give Mr. Symington rope just as I&rsquo;ve
given it to Mr. Corrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may prove awfully expensive rope, Mr. Risk,&rdquo;
ventured Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to pay for my amusement,&rdquo; the
other pleasantly returned, &ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t want me to
tell you again that I will replace every share it may cost Miss
Carstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; said Colin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only&mdash;well, you have been so good to me that
I&rsquo;d hate to see you lose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&nbsp; Yes, but think of the game, Hayward!&nbsp;
And we&rsquo;re going to win that.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s going to
be the most tremendously interesting <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>business I ever tackled.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t mind danger, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve had no
experience, but I&rsquo;m at your service, Mr. Risk.&nbsp; I
suppose,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;Symington has already
converted some of the 500 shares into cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may assume that much.&nbsp; To put it mildly, he has
been on the spree since the day he got the new
certificates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had him watched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I have gone into his past to
some extent.&nbsp; He is not a desirable person, I fear.&nbsp;
But we shall leave him for the present.&nbsp; My sister and Miss
Carstairs, also your friend West, are dining with me to-night,
and I hope you are free to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin flushed with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like you,&rdquo; continued Risk, &ldquo;to
make your quarters here for the present.&nbsp; Sharp has a room
ready for you.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;m going to ask you an
impertinent question.&nbsp; Have you any debts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;well, I owe my father &pound;100,&rdquo; the
young man replied ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pay it; and if you think you have any grudge
against him, forget it.&nbsp; For this year I will pay your
salary quarterly, in advance.&nbsp; <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>Don&rsquo;t thank me.&nbsp; I simply
want you to be able to serve me with as free a mind, and as light
a heart, as possible.&nbsp; Frankly, you&rsquo;re an
experiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a kindly laugh Risk proceeded to
write a cheque.</p>
<p>It was no shame to Colin then if his eyes were moist.&nbsp;
Surely his father would think kindlier of him now.</p>
<p>An hour later he and Kitty were face to face.&nbsp; Ages long
it seemed since their parting in the little wood, less than three
weeks ago!&nbsp; How much had happened since then!&nbsp; Perhaps
Kitty was more at her ease than he.&nbsp; She had slipped into
the new, pleasant life as though she belonged to it.&nbsp; She
was still a little shy, but not awkwardly so.&nbsp; She had never
been &ldquo;countrified,&rdquo; yet Colin had always thought of
her as a country maid&mdash;and had loved her none the less for
that.&nbsp; In sunlight and moonlight he had deemed her the
prettiest creature alive.&nbsp; But now, under the shaded
electric lamps of a London drawing-room in a white muslin frock
that gave glimpses of her neck and arms, he beheld her, and his
faithful heart ached at her fresh loveliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful?&rdquo; she whispered,
smiling, as they shook hands.</p>
<p>Poor Colin!&nbsp; He managed to smile in return, <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>but not a
word could he find, for in that moment he realized that he loved
her more than ever, and that if his love had been wellnigh
hopeless before, it was utterly hopeless now.&nbsp; For with all
his resolutions to put her out of his life on coming to London,
he had indulged a dream of fighting for success in order that he
might one day rescue her from dreariness or hardship, and somehow
win her for his own.&nbsp; Alas, now he comprehended only too
fully what the Zeniths meant to himself.&nbsp; Kitty would be a
very rich young woman.&nbsp; He could serve her in nothing at
all.&nbsp; What an irony that the man who had given him his first
step upwards&mdash;and a great step, too&mdash;should be the man
to set his dearest desire beyond his reach!&nbsp; Well, there was
nothing for it but to cleave to duty and have done with
dreams.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it was a cheerful little dinner-party, and during
it the love-lorn young man and Hilda Risk laid the foundations of
a lasting friendship.&nbsp; Towards the close of the repast Kitty
was telling the host of her father&rsquo;s unfinished novel which
Mr. West had just completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did it in six days, Mr. Risk,&rdquo; she said
warmly, &ldquo;and I could not have told that it was not my
father&rsquo;s own work.&nbsp; It was wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said West, in his
matter-of-fact voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was next to nothing for
me to do, for the last act was foreshadowed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
great play, Risk.&nbsp; Craven of the <i>Planet</i>, whom I got
to read it right away, admitted as much this very day, though he
wouldn&rsquo;t accept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much unlike recent successes, I suppose,&rdquo;
said West drily.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I believe it would draw all
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carstairs,&rdquo; said Risk kindly,
&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see your father&rsquo;s play
performed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s shining eyes answered for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can persuade Craven,&rdquo; remarked Risk,
turning to West.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you arrange a meeting between
us for the day after to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jove!&rdquo; said West softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
thing&rsquo;s done!&nbsp; Miss Carstairs, take my word for it,
that play will bring you a little fortune.&nbsp; Risk, God bless
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty looked from one to the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it&mdash;is it really and truly going to be?&rdquo; she asked,
tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to Mr. Risk,&rdquo; cried West in high
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you may, Miss Carstairs,&rdquo; Risk said <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>with that
amused look of his.&nbsp; &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t count on the
fortune just yet.&nbsp; Still, I&rsquo;ll make the best terms I
can for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. West,&rdquo; she put in quickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think me ungrateful and horrid, Mr.
Risk, but I don&rsquo;t wish you to&mdash;to trouble about the
play at all unless Mr. West promises&mdash;on paper, too&mdash;to
take half the profits&mdash;if any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; shouted West, indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness me,&rdquo; said Hilda, interrupting her talk
with Colin, &ldquo;what on earth is the matter,
Anthony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my dear,&rdquo; replied her brother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Merely Anthony&rsquo;s little way of receiving a decent
business proposition.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned to Kitty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never mind, Miss Carstairs; we three shall have a talk
together later, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharp came into the room with a note on a salver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messenger boy brought it, sir; said it was
immediate,&rdquo; he murmured to his master, as he presented the
salver to Kitty.&nbsp; &ldquo;No answer, madam,&rdquo; he said
aloud, and retired.</p>
<p>Kitty had taken the note mechanically, but now as she sat
staring at it, the colour ebbed from her face.&nbsp; The plain
envelope was directed to her&mdash;in rather shaky
writing&mdash;care of Miss <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Risk, 366 Long Acre; apparently
Hilda&rsquo;s servant had sent the messenger on to Aberdare
Mansions.</p>
<p>Anthony West alone made any effort to sustain the
conversation, but then he was the only person present to whom the
incident appeared ordinary, and he, too, soon fell silent at the
sight of the girl&rsquo;s pallor.</p>
<p>At last the host said gently: &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better
open it, Miss Carstairs?&nbsp; It may be nothing so very serious
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty seemed to nerve herself; she even smiled
faintly&mdash;as she tore away the flap.&nbsp; She took out a
piece of ruled paper folded once&mdash;a page torn from a
note-book&mdash;opened it, and forced herself to read the two
lines scrawled upon it in pencil.</p>
<p>Then the paper fell from her fingers, and with a little cry of
pain she put up her hands and hid her face.</p>
<h2><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilda</span> was the first to make a
movement.&nbsp; She rose and passed quickly round the table to
the apparently stricken girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;remember you are
among friends here&mdash;friends, who will not permit any person
or thing to harm you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laid a reassuring hand on
the girl&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>The host also rose, signing to Colin and West to follow him
from the room. But just then Kitty let her hands fall from her
face. No longer was it pale, for the shock of fear was past, and
her cheeks glowed with honest indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Risk, please don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; she said a
little unsteadily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish any one to go
away. I&rsquo;m so sorry to upset everything like
this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; Risk said
gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;As my sister has just remarked, we are your
friends, and we are all ready and anxious to serve you. You
really want us to remain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned to Hilda. &ldquo;I want
you <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>to
read it aloud,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the note.</p>
<p>Hilda picked up the paper, and she, too, flushed as her eyes
took in the pencilled words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beast!&rdquo; she muttered under her breath. She
took West&rsquo;s seat which he had vacated for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This note,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;has neither
address nor signature.&nbsp; It has evidently been pencilled by a
person under the influence of rage, illness,
or&mdash;alcohol.&nbsp; It asks:&mdash;&rsquo;Do your new friends
know where you got the money that brought you to London?&rsquo; .
. .&nbsp; That is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin went ruddy, half rose, and subsided with mingled
feelings&mdash;anger at the insult to Kitty, dread lest for her
sake he should be forced to confess to sending her the hundred
pounds, and a sudden recognition that not so long ago he had held
a similar piece of paper bearing an anonymous message in
pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Kitty in a steadier voice, though
she was pale again, &ldquo;will you, please, tell them all you
know about me, Hilda; all I have told you about
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The host poured a little wine into a glass and set it before
her, saying: &ldquo;My dear Miss Carstairs, I want to know only
one thing.&nbsp; Who is the unspeakable cad who wrote
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Kitty
took a sip and smiled faintly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you can be
bothered listening to my rather unpleasant little story, which I
want Hilda to tell,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I think you
may guess the writer&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; At least, I can think of
only one person who would do such a thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Symington!&rdquo; burst from Colin&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman who, unfortunately, has never called
here,&rdquo; said Risk quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it can be no other,&rdquo; cried Hilda, in
unwonted excitement.</p>
<p>Colin was on his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Risk, will you
excuse&mdash;&rdquo; he was beginning when Sharp entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Symington,&rdquo; the servant intimated,
&ldquo;wishes to speak with Miss Carstairs on the
&rsquo;phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were blank looks until Hilda, with recovered coolness,
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharp, will you tell Mr. Symington that Miss Carstairs
is afraid of contamination, even over the wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Hilda,&rdquo; her brother remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you got it clearly, Sharp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the servant answered, and calmly
repeated the words.&nbsp; Then he went out.</p>
<p>Risk turned to Colin, who was still standing <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>and gave a
nod, murmuring: &ldquo;All right, Hayward, we&rsquo;ll excuse
you.&nbsp; Good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin bowed to the ladies, and with a curious set look on his
face left the room.</p>
<p>Hilda glanced at her brother, but said nothing.&nbsp; Kitty
was feeling a little hurt, and, perhaps, a little relieved
also.&nbsp; Why should Colin have wanted to escape hearing her
story?&nbsp; On the other hand, it would, perhaps, be less trying
to hear it told without his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have coffee in the study, John,&rdquo; said
Hilda suddenly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll try to do what Kitty
asks.&nbsp; I do think you and Anthony ought to know how
abominably she has been treated, especially as one of her
wretched persecutors seems to be losing his head and getting to
work again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; said Risk, &ldquo;I confess to acute
curiosity.&nbsp; In two minutes we shall do as you suggest,
Hilda.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Miss Carstairs, let us try to come to
some agreement with West about the play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a tactful suggestion, for Kitty was requiring a change
of thought rather badly just then.</p>
<p>Later, as they were passing to the study, Sharp got a word
with his master in the hall.</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>&ldquo;Mr. Hayward asked me to tell you, sir, that he
was making a call at the Kingsway Grand Hotel, but that he did
not expect to be long in returning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. . . .&nbsp; Did he ask for anything before
he left the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A flexible cane, sir, which I chanced to be able to
provide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk nodded, and looking serious, was about to follow his
guests, when a thought seemed to strike him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharp, did Mr. Symington make any response to the
message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharp hesitated, &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he replied at last,
solemnly, &ldquo;I should say he contaminated the wire,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>In common justice it should be stated here that Alexander
Symington was not a faithful slave to alcohol.&nbsp; As a rule he
kept the upper hand.&nbsp; A full record of his adult life,
however, would show that at long intervals and at times of
extreme excitement, he lost his grip, fell, and simply
wallowed.&nbsp; His collapse on this occasion was probably the
result of his converting a hundred Zeniths <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>into nearly
five hundred pounds sterling.&nbsp; With pockets full of notes
and gold, and with the sure prospect of being able to refill them
as soon as emptied&mdash;refill them over and over again&mdash;it
is small wonder that he became reckless in an abnormal
degree.&nbsp; At all events, the money was not in his pockets for
an hour when, with the assistance of a couple of fellows no
finer-souled than himself, he entered upon a bout of dissipation
as wild as it was varied.&nbsp; Even Kitty was forgotten. . .
.</p>
<p>And now he was in process of &ldquo;coming to
himself&rdquo;&mdash;and a very unpleasing process it was.&nbsp;
Physically, though weakened, he was less disorganized than might
have been expected; mentally, however, his state was that of
extreme annoyance with himself and savage resentment against the
world in general, and two persons in particular.&nbsp; He could
not remember all the idiotic acts he had committed in the course
of those crazy days and nights, but he was clearly and
disagreeably aware that besides squandering four hundred and
seventy pounds, he had presented his two boon companions with a
hundred Zeniths apiece for no reason or purpose that he could
soberly name.&nbsp; He was further tormented by the bitter
reflection that he had wasted ten <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>valuable days.&nbsp; For all he
knew, Kitty, in that period, might have put herself beyond his
reach for good and all.&nbsp; Also he had lately received from
Corrie a somewhat peremptory note requesting him to report
progress, and breathing a novel and unpleasant spirit of
independence.</p>
<p>It was in this harassed condition, and with a still clouded
intelligence, that he had obeyed the two impulses in the
direction of Kitty, of which we have seen the results&mdash;so
far.&nbsp; And now, not so many minutes after the telephone
episode, he was already cursing himself for a silly fool, and
asking what madness was upon him that he should have as good as
warned the girl against himself.</p>
<p>He had determined to spend this evening in the sitting-room of
his suite reserved in the Kingsway Grand Hotel, a hostelry
largely patronized by unattached gentlemen with money to
burn.&nbsp; An hour ago he had dined very lightly and
temperately, but the reaction from the previous over-indulgence
had soon afterwards demanded more stimulant, and a pint bottle of
champagne stood on a small table convenient to his easy
chair.&nbsp; He was expecting his two friends, but hoping that
something&mdash;a motor accident, fatal, for choice&mdash;might
yet prevent them from turning up.&nbsp; It would be many a day
before he forgave <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>these two, for although he had freely presented them
the Zeniths, he now regarded them about as kindly as if they had
robbed him.</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette with an unsteady hand, took a mouthful of
wine and lay back in his chair, sluggish of body, sullen of
soul.&nbsp; When, a moment later, he heard the door open, he
swore under his breath, but did not so much as turn his
head.&nbsp; He anticipated a greeting as the door was
shut&mdash;a bluff greeting of the &ldquo;What ho&rdquo; order;
wherefore the words that came after a brief pause were something
of a shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started up to see &ldquo;young Hayward&rdquo; standing over
him, with a look in his eyes that boded anything but
goodwill.</p>
<p>Colin was full of fury, but it was the frigid sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce do you want?&rdquo; said Symington at
last, and his hand stole behind him.&nbsp; His recent
pleasure-hunt had included visits to one or two rather queer
corners of London town, down by the docks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want is a thrashing,&rdquo; answered Colin,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m here to give it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington&rsquo;s complexion went from scarlet to grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the &mdash;&mdash; do you mean by intruding <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>here?&nbsp;
If you don&rsquo;t clear out&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; His hand went up
with a glitter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out of this, you young fool, or
by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swish!&nbsp; Like a flash the whangee cane smote his
knuckles.&nbsp; With a cry he let drop the weapon.&nbsp; Colin
kicked it across the room.</p>
<p>Hissing with wrath and pain, Symington sprang up and made a
dash for the bell.&nbsp; No use!&nbsp; He was seized by the
collar, shaken vigorously, then dragged to the table in the
centre of the room, from which the dessert had not been
removed.&nbsp; Mercilessly he was thrown across it, his face in a
dish of raisins, and in that undignified position, vainly
struggling, he received a most painful chastisement.</p>
<p>Often afterwards Colin, whose weight and muscle were nothing
exceptional, would wonder how on earth he had managed to handle
successfully a heavy man like Symington; but love and hate
combined with honest rage gave him, for the time being, the
strength of three, and moreover his victim was flabby after a
long debauch.</p>
<p>The noise of the caning coupled with the involuntary
exclamations of the sufferer were, however, not long in
attracting attention, and a knock on the door warned Colin that
it was time to desist.&nbsp; Putting his whole heart into a final
<a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>cut,
which brought forth a yelp of anguish, he loosed his grip, saying
rather breathlessly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the reply to your anonymous notes, Mr.
Symington, and if you want to call the police now, pray do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A waiter, mouth open, was staring from the doorway.</p>
<p>Symington stood up, his expression devilish.&nbsp; He had a
fruit knife in his hand&mdash;a frail, pretty thing, yet
pointed.&nbsp; He lunged at his enemy&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Again
the cane swished, and the knife fell to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; gasped the waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; inquired Colin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it to be
the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&nbsp; Get out of this!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make
you sorrier than any police judge could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Colin, turning to the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; he added, over his
shoulder, &ldquo;if I were you, I&rsquo;d get the waiter to
remove the raisins from your chin and left eyebrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With that, perhaps the unkindest cut of all, he went out, leaving
Symington almost beside himself with passion.</p>
<p>As for the waiter, the unfortunate creature was so tactless as
to smile at the raisins, and two days later he was dismissed from
the hotel service.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>As
soon as he reached the street, Colin realized that he was shaking
all over.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a rage I must have been in!&rdquo; he
said to himself, half gladly, half ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess he won&rsquo;t trouble Kitty again, and I
don&rsquo;t see how he&rsquo;s going to get at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Colin did not know Symington, or he would have, at least,
qualified his confidence.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, by thrashing
the man he had simply turned a cad into a blackguard.&nbsp; But
he drove back to Aberdare Mansions feeling that he had been able
to do something for his beloved after all, though she must never
know of it, and he arrived there happier than he had been for
months.</p>
<p>Risk met him in the hall with a quizzical smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found him out, I suppose, Hayward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to do, Mr. Risk,&rdquo; was the
blithe reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I found him in, and I fancy
he&rsquo;ll not move far to-night, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; said Risk, his eyes on the
cane, &ldquo;you whacked the beggar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the best of my ability.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colin found his
hand being shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was splendid, Hayward,&rdquo; Risk said gravely,
&ldquo;and we must hope it was also wise.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ll
forget about it for the present.&nbsp; Come along and have your
coffee.&nbsp; We have heard Miss Carstairs&rsquo; <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>story, and
West and I are her willing servants, till she comes to her
own.&nbsp; But, of course, she must not know we are working for
her, and she must, if possible, be induced to forget those ugly
little incidents of to-night&mdash;or, at any rate, be prevented
from dwelling on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, the night being exquisite, Colin
walked home with Kitty, West escorting Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Risk is giving you plenty to do, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; Kitty remarked, making an effort to shake off the
feeling of restraint that had come upon her on finding herself
alone with Colin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Colin, who was hampered by a similar
sensation.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s worth working for.&nbsp;
He has given me a chance that I might have sought in vain all my
life.&nbsp; But never mind about me, Kitty,&rdquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish very much to know what you&mdash;or
rather Miss Risk&mdash;told the others while I was absent
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather not talk about it,&rdquo; she
said, after a short pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. West, or Mr. Risk,
will tell you, if you really want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty, why do you say that, and in such a
tone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go away almost as soon as I asked Hilda to
tell my story?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; Well, because&mdash;&rdquo; he
hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;because it suddenly occurred to me
that&mdash;that there was a thing I must attend to,&rdquo; he
concluded lamely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good heavens, Kitty, you surely
didn&rsquo;t imagine that I was anything but keen to hear your
story!&nbsp; Ever since I learned you were in London I&rsquo;ve
been wondering how the great change came about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His earnestness overcame her doubts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a horrid thing, Colin,&rdquo; she declared
self-reproachfully, &ldquo;but I wanted to make sure that you did
not despise me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despise you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;for running away from Dunford, and for accepting
the kindness of strangers as I have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an absurd idea, Kitty! I won&rsquo;t tell you how
glad I was to hear you were in London and in the care of such
friends.&nbsp; Show that you trust me a little better by telling
me how it all came about.&nbsp; By the way, have you heard from
Dunford since you left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sent my aunt my address,
and told her I was all right, but she has not answered.&nbsp;
Well, I&rsquo;m not so surprised at that as at not hearing from
Sam, the postman.&nbsp; It was he who helped me to get
away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you begin at the
beginning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;only you must promise not to discuss it
afterwards.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a pretty story, Colin, and only
in self-protection did I ask Hilda to tell it to-night.&nbsp;
Well, here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told it simply and in few words, and he heard her to the
end without a single interruption.&nbsp; Now and then, indeed,
when her voice wavered, he would have given all his future to
have taken her for one moment into his arms.&nbsp; The incident
of the &pound;100 brought a flush to his face, while he blessed
the thought that had caused him to send her the means for escape;
but the tale of her uncle&rsquo;s hideous treachery turned him
ghastly with wrath and pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;the journey that
started so miserably ended most wonderfully, and here I am with
all my dreams come true&rdquo;&mdash;she gave a small rueful
laugh&mdash;&ldquo;except one.&nbsp; For I used to dream of being
brave and independent and even adventurous; and
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kitty, thank God you didn&rsquo;t arrive in London
alone!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she returned softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was a
little fool to imagine I could ever have stood alone and made my
own way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m self-supporting now with my typing, but
that&rsquo;s all thanks to Hilda.&nbsp; <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Colin, did
you ever hear of anything so wonderful as the way things have
turned out for me?&nbsp; Do you know, once or twice I&rsquo;ve
thought it might all have been planned out by Mr. Risk&mdash;that
he, for my father&rsquo;s sake, might have been secretly watching
over me. . . .&nbsp; Some day, when I know him better, I&rsquo;ll
ask him straight about the &pound;100.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
think I might do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Colin cheerfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And so now you are perfectly happy, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am!&rdquo; she answered, with just a trace of
defiance.&nbsp; She was not going to admit that there was
something lacking, and perhaps she was not quite sure what the
&ldquo;something&rdquo; was.&nbsp; And, of course, it was nothing
to her that Colin, earlier in the evening, had appeared to be
greatly taken with Hilda&mdash;and Hilda&rsquo;s lovely eyes!</p>
<p>Later, he mentioned that West and he desired to take her and
Hilda to a theatre on the coming Friday.&nbsp; Kitty had already
been to several theatres, yet, somehow, the prospect thrilled her
more than it had done prior to previous visits, though her
acceptance of the invitation, given subject to Hilda&rsquo;s
approval, was little more than polite.</p>
<p>They were nearly home when Colin said rather
diffidently&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised not to discuss Dunford or
the people there, but, Kitty, I&rsquo;d just like to hear that
you are no longer afraid of that wretched worm,
Symington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment she replied: &ldquo;No, Colin.&nbsp; For that
moment, at dinner, I was afraid, horribly afraid, I admit.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ve got over it.&nbsp; For what can the man
do?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> last we saw them John and
Rachel Corrie, apart from the conversation necessitated by
business, had scarcely spoken to each other.&nbsp; The man kept a
sullen silence, lest in speech he might betray his real
intentions; the woman, having come to mistrust in all his ways
the being whom she loved more than herself, held her peace lest
she should lead him into self-betrayal, for now she feared the
worst so greatly that she could not face the sure knowledge
thereof.&nbsp; Rachel knew by this time why she had heard no more
from Kitty.&nbsp; Her three letters to the girl had never passed
beyond the post office&mdash;she had actually and secretly
witnessed her brother destroy the last&mdash;and she naturally
assumed that if Kitty had written again, her letter had met a
similar fate.</p>
<p>Although the new assistant and postman were conversant with
their duties, Corrie never failed to postmark with his own hand
both outward and <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>inward mails.&nbsp; His manner had become disagreeably
furtive; always he seemed to be watching, waiting for something
to happen.&nbsp; Rachel&rsquo;s poor heart bled for him; she
blamed the sin more than the sinner; and she would have given her
soul to save his.&nbsp; Night after night she lay long awake,
brooding, scheming to the end that he might be rescued&mdash;in a
worldly sense, to begin with.&nbsp; She fondly believed that if
he were drawn back from his present sinning, his life for the
future would be sinless.&nbsp; She believed, also, that it was
Symington whom she would have to overcome in the first
place.&nbsp; To Rachel Corrie, Symington, in the night watches,
appeared as Satan himself.</p>
<p>And at last, at a sultry midnight, such a midnight as had
witnessed her dreadful deed for her brother&rsquo;s sake, a vague
idea drifted, from Heaven knows where, into her distracted, weary
mind, and lodged there.&nbsp; Ere she slept it had developed to a
grim purpose, which even the searching light of morning could not
weaken.</p>
<p>She would render Symington powerless, helpless, by depriving
him of the Zenith certificates! . . .&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; It
cost her many more sleepless hours and much aching thought before
she could answer the question.&nbsp; But eventually, the way was
found, and while it appalled her, she would not <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>turn
back.&nbsp; However, she would have to bide her time.&nbsp; For
one thing, the mill was at present too busy&mdash;the mill which,
you will remember, was one of John Corrie&rsquo;s properties
apart from the general store&mdash;and the mill was involved in
her scheme.&nbsp; For another, a word with Symington might have
helpful results.</p>
<p>It was on the third evening following that of his castigation
that Symington appeared in Dunford.&nbsp; He came in response to
a curt note from the postmaster: &ldquo;It is time you and me had
a talk.&nbsp; Look sharp.&rdquo;&nbsp; A telegram preceded
him.&nbsp; For the first time since his last visit Corrie
mentioned the man&rsquo;s name to Rachel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Symington will be here &rsquo;tween eight and
nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be out,&rdquo; she returned calmly.</p>
<p>For a moment he was taken aback.&nbsp; Then&mdash;&ldquo;As ye
please,&rdquo; he said, and after a short pause added: &ldquo;I
expect your niece will get the shares before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not look at her, nor did she at him as she
replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, John.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be glad when
it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left the house at the hour the train was due, and took the
road which led to White Farm and also to the mill, a couple of
miles farther on.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>Symington arrived at the cottage in a bad humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you keep on bothering me for?&rdquo;
he demanded the moment he was in the parlour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going ahead as quickly as I can.&nbsp; Do you
want me to ruin the whole thing by rushing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use in losing your temper,&rdquo; said Corrie
coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fortnight past since ye started
to get a hold o&rsquo; the girl.&nbsp; I want to ken what
ye&rsquo;ve been doing in London, besides enjoying
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about enjoyment!&nbsp; I tell you
I&rsquo;ve been busy the whole time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what ha&rsquo; ye done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington took out a cigar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here&mdash;what
are you trying to drive me for?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s at the back of
this cry for haste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chance o&rsquo; the postman getting
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, curse him for a nuisance, and you for a
bungler!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind, I&rsquo;ve got that letter!&rdquo; snarled
Corrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never use it? . . .&nbsp; However, I may
tell you that I&rsquo;ve completed my arrangements for the
capture of Miss Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may they be?&rdquo;</p>

194</span>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better not tell you.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re so tender-hearted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grey shadow came over Corrie&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is&mdash;is it going to hurt her?&rdquo; he
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I canna consent to her being
hurt&mdash;seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington laughed shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;d
hurt Kitty, do you?&nbsp; Sometimes I fancy you&rsquo;re a bit
cracked, Corrie!&nbsp; Well, I must admit it&rsquo;s going to be
a little unpleasant, inconvenient, for her&mdash;but nothing
worse.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s going to disappear for a
time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re better not to know in case you&rsquo;re
asked&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postmaster plucked at his lower lip.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he mumbled, &ldquo;maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And young Hayward&rsquo;s going to disappear
likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&nbsp; Are ye no&rsquo; afraid? . . .&nbsp; But how
am I to believe ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me four days&mdash;a week at most.&nbsp; Now,
don&rsquo;t ask any more questions, for I&rsquo;m not going to
answer them.&nbsp; As I said, you&rsquo;re better not to know
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one.&nbsp; How long will it take, think ye
to&mdash;to make her give in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington had drunk a good deal of wine on <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>the train,
or he might not have answered as he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long does it take to starve a healthy
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>In the dusk Symington was nearing the farm when, from a gate
in the hedge, Rachel Corrie stepped into his path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a word wi&rsquo; ye, Mr. Symington,&rdquo; she
said bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And first I&rsquo;ll tell ye that John Desna ken
o&rsquo; this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was annoyed at the interruption,
for he had much to think of before he slept that night, and he
was returning to London by the early morning train.&nbsp; Also he
was tormented by a craving for something to drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis about the Zeniths,&rdquo; she proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your business, I should say, Miss
Corrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say different.&nbsp; But I only want ye to satisfy me
that ye are dealing fair with my brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you insinuate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need for temper,&rdquo; she went on steadily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;John maybe wouldna like to ask ye himself, but I&rsquo;m
going to put a straight question, for it&rsquo;s been on my mind
for a while now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;Kindly come to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&nbsp; Have ye or have ye not parted wi&rsquo;
any o&rsquo; the shares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His indignation was well assumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you were a
man&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m only a woman, and not one of the blind,
trusting sort, Mr. Symington.&nbsp; Still, I&rsquo;m as curious
as any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he gave an ironic laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well, Miss
Corrie; I don&rsquo;t want you to lose any more of your beauty
sleep, so I give you my word that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ye&rsquo;ll let me see the certificates, Mr.
Symington,&rdquo; she interrupted very firmly.</p>
<p>For an instant he hesitated.&nbsp; He might tell her that they
were in his banker&rsquo;s safe.&nbsp; But no: better exhibit
them and have done with the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was not aware of your affection for your
brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d consider your request
an insult, and refuse it point-blank.&nbsp; However, you can come
along to the house and be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He prepared for other questions, but she asked none, and
presently he was showing her into the farm-house parlour, saying:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch them at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited in the twilight, listening with all her <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>nerves, as
it were.&nbsp; She heard him go upstairs, she counted his
movements in the room directly overhead.</p>
<p>Symington knew he was taking no small risk.&nbsp; Originally
the certificates, folded separately, had made a tape-tied bundle
of ten, each certificate representing five hundred shares.&nbsp;
Now there were only nine.&nbsp; But Symington took from his
pocket a certificate for one hundred shares, and inserted it in
the bundle.&nbsp; He could not tell how familiar she might be
with the documents, but he trusted that she would be satisfied
with finding the number of them correct, and reckoned that if she
did insist on examining them separately, the dusk would prevent
her detecting the discrepancy.&nbsp; So he came downstairs,
whistling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye,&rdquo; she said at once, without even
touching the bundle; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be getting home
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For she had discovered what she wanted to know&mdash;not with
her eyes, but with her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly old fool!&rdquo; Symington remarked to himself,
much relieved, as he went upstairs again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
needn&rsquo;t go on worrying about her, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He entered his bedroom, returned the one hundred share
certificate to his pocket, and deposited the bundle in an
immensely heavy oaken chest, steel-bound and fastened to the <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>floor in
the window.&nbsp; It had been the Symington &ldquo;strong
box&rdquo; for generations.&nbsp; Only lately had the idea of
superseding it with a modern safe occurred to the present
owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to Glasgow for a price list
to-night,&rdquo; he thought, withdrawing the queer, stumpy key,
and replacing the chintz cover, which gave the chest something of
the appearance of an ottoman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll write
to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just then his importunate thirst assailed
him once more, and drove him downstairs to a cupboard in the
parlour.</p>

199</span>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning, about a week later,
John Risk on his arrival in the City, found his sister waiting in
his private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ordered to Newcastle to-morrow, for a couple
of days,&rdquo; she informed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What am I to do
about Kitty?&nbsp; Naturally, she&rsquo;d imagine all sorts of
things if I told her she must not leave the flat during my
absence, and I can hardly afford to tell the editor I
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take her with you, Hilda.&nbsp; Why not make a
little holiday of it, and when you&rsquo;ve finished the job at
Newcastle, take a week by the sea somewhere?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
had no break this summer.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re looking a bit
fagged.&nbsp; Of course I&rsquo;ll stand the racket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old thing, I don&rsquo;t believe I can
refuse!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll post you a cheque before
midday.&nbsp; But now I must ask you to run away.&nbsp; This is
my busy morning.&nbsp; By the way, you can tell <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Miss Kitty
that the play is going on almost immediately.&nbsp; West caved in
last night, and agreed to take his share, and, as luck would have
it, &mdash;&rsquo;s recent venture has turned out a frost, and
the theatre is available&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John! how many thousands is this going to cost
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, I think.&nbsp; I believe in the play.&nbsp;
However, that&rsquo;s none of your business.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t think any the less of West for taking his
share?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&nbsp; Besides Kitty forced him by declaring
she would not have the play go on at all, if he
refused.&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; said Hilda rather
hurriedly, and with some colour in her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment.&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t been followed by
that man, have you?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Why do you ask?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would, my dear.&nbsp; Symington is in town at
present, and I happen to know he has been selling more
shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! . . .&nbsp; But, John, isn&rsquo;t it time to
act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nearly, I hope.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all,
Hilda.&nbsp; Good luck to your holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed him and went out.&nbsp; A slight frown crossed his
forehead for a moment.&nbsp; Then he pressed one of several
buttons on his desk.</p>
<p>Colin entered.&nbsp; He had a letter in his hand.</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;May I speak first, Mr. Risk?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been waiting to show you this.&rdquo;&nbsp; He handed over the
letter; it was from the superintendent of the hospital where Sam
the postman lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Risk, &ldquo;this is what was
wanted!&nbsp; &lsquo;The operation on the skull has been
successful,&rsquo; he read, &lsquo;and the patient is now well
enough to give you a short interview.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; Hayward,
you must go North by the first train, learn all you can, and
instruct him to hold his tongue for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can catch the 11.30 train,&rdquo; said Colin, who was
already acquiring the decisive ways of his friend and employer,
&ldquo;and may be there in time to see him to-night.&nbsp; You
wish me to return at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to take in Dunford on your way back and get
me one or two photos.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you a note of what I
require along with the camera.&nbsp; But that needn&rsquo;t take
you more than a couple of hours.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you want to
look up your people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all from home this month&mdash;thank you
for thinking of it.&nbsp; I ought to tell you that my father and
I have made it up&mdash;through the post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&nbsp; Now, before you go, will you
do me a rough sketch of the postman&rsquo;s house <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>before it
was burned&mdash;that is, a drawing of the front, showing door,
windows, etc., as correctly proportioned as you can make
them.&nbsp; Jot the colourings at the side. . . .&nbsp; One thing
more: you might break your return journey at Newcastle, for an
hour or so.&nbsp; My sister and Miss Carstairs will be there
to-morrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wire you where to find them to the
hospital this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin felt grateful, but merely returned a &ldquo;Very well,
Mr. Risk,&rdquo; and he hastened to his own office to get through
the work on hand.&nbsp; The request for a sketch of Sam&rsquo;s
old house puzzled him, as did the photographic business, but he
possessed the valuable wit for knowing when to suppress
questions.</p>
<p>Risk immediately plunged into a small ocean of
correspondence.&nbsp; He had an extraordinary number of financial
interests, and they really interested him apart from their
finance. . . .</p>
<p>A secretary entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Boon, of the Westminster Film Co., is here,
sir.&nbsp; He has an appointment with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk glanced at the clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;In two minutes,&rdquo;
he said, returning to the correspondence, &ldquo;show him
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary knew by this time that two minutes to Mr. Risk
meant exactly 120 seconds <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>and on the 121st Mr. Boon was
admitted.&nbsp; His visit lasted about fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Before he left he was introduced to Colin, with whom he had a
few minutes&rsquo; conversation, which was probably more
enlightening to himself than to the young man; and he took away
with him the rude sketch of the Dunford postman&rsquo;s
abode.</p>
<p>Rather late in the evening Colin, by special permission, was
sitting at Sam&rsquo;s bedside.&nbsp; The postman was still weak,
and the nurse had warned the visitor against anything in the way
of excitement, but his memory was clear enough, and there was
not, after all, a great deal to be remembered.&nbsp; Colin was
soon in possession of the few facts worth having; they formed, at
least, a valuable little appendix to Kitty&rsquo;s story.&nbsp;
As to his assailant on the night of the fire, Sam frankly
admitted that he had nothing better than suspicions to offer; yet
he was convinced that the house had been deliberately set on
fire, and that he had been assaulted in his weakness either by
Corrie, or Symington, or both.</p>
<p>But Sam was not greatly interested in his own affairs.&nbsp;
Time enough to think of punishment and revenge when he was on his
feet again, he declared.&nbsp; He wanted to hear about Kitty.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>Colin
did his best to oblige him, leaving out, of course, all reference
to Symington&rsquo;s last outbreak, and explaining that Kitty was
not yet aware of her old friend&rsquo;s misfortune and
illness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, quite right,&rdquo; said Sam.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So long as she&rsquo;s in good health, and wi&rsquo; kind
friends, I&rsquo;m content.&nbsp; And before long I&rsquo;ll be
getting the letter ye say she wrote me, just after she got to
London.&nbsp; Ye see, we couldna trust Corrie, and she would send
it to Peter Hart, the shepherd, in the next postal
district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell her simply that you&rsquo;ve
had an accident,&rdquo; said Colin, &ldquo;so you may expect a
new letter from her immediately. . . .&nbsp; Now I see the nurse
looking at me, and I suppose my time is up.&nbsp; But I must tell
you, from Mr. Risk, that your house will be rebuilt, and ready
for you by the time you are ready for it.&nbsp; Not a word,
Sam!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use arguing with Mr. Risk, I know! . .
.&nbsp; Well, I must go.&nbsp; Keep everything a secret for the
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam clung to the young man&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell
her,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;to look out for Symington.&nbsp;
Tell her the news o&rsquo; her has done me a power o&rsquo;
good.&nbsp; Good luck to ye, Mr. Colin&mdash;good luck to ye
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin hurried to the inn, wrote a letter, and <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>just
managed to catch the late night mail for the south.&nbsp; The
letter would reach Risk by the second morning delivery.&nbsp;
Then he re-read the telegram he had found waiting for him at the
hospital.&nbsp; It seemed to give him pleasant thoughts, for he
smiled.&nbsp; It was from Hilda, and invited him to take tea the
following afternoon in the Station Hotel, Newcastle.</p>
<p>Next morning he stepped from the early train at Dunford.&nbsp;
In order to turn aside any local curiosity, he went straight to
his father&rsquo;s house, and got the caretaker to give him
breakfast, explaining that he had called on his way to London to
collect one or two small articles from his old room.&nbsp;
Thereafter he strolled around with his hand-camera and secured
some &ldquo;souvenir snapshots,&rdquo; as he put it to an
interested villager.&nbsp; In the course of his stroll he
recorded&mdash;surreptitiously, it should be remarked&mdash;a
view of the back of Corrie&rsquo;s cottage, and another of the
scene immediately in front of Sam&rsquo;s ruined dwelling.</p>
<p>Passing the post office on the way to the station, he obtained
a glimpse of Corrie talking to a farmer in the doorway.&nbsp;
Though he detested the man with all his soul, he was tempted to
make room for a little pity, so haggard and wretched was the
postmaster&rsquo;s appearance.&nbsp; Corrie, after a <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>slight
start, gave a perfunctory wave of salutation, which Colin,
feeling a hypocrite, returned.</p>
<p>By noon he was in the train again, counting the miles to
Newcastle.&nbsp; Within half an hour of the train&rsquo;s leaving
Dunford, Corrie dispatched a telegram to
Symington&mdash;&ldquo;Left at 11.50.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the same hour in London, a message was flashed North to
greet our traveller with a great disappointment.&nbsp; He had to
change at Carlisle; and as he was boarding the Newcastle train
there, his heart full of Kitty, hope struggling once more against
resignation, an official carrying an orange envelope came along
inquiring for &ldquo;a Mr. Colin Hayward.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
presently Colin was reading Risk&rsquo;s message&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urgent.&nbsp; Return straight to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was just time to rush back to the express train he had
so recently left.&nbsp; Afterwards there was more than enough
time for wonder and worry.</p>
<h2><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the afternoon of the same day,
which happened to be the weekly half-holiday, Rachel Corrie
returned from a longish walk undertaken, as she had announced to
her brother at dinner, in the hope of relieving a severe
headache.&nbsp; In these days it was for her a rare occurrence to
leave the house at all, and a common one to have a headache, but
Corrie had been too self-engrossed to be moved by surprise or
sympathy.</p>
<p>Entering the cottage, Rachel certainly did not look much the
better of the outing; she seemed, in fact, to be suffering from a
faintness, for at first she leaned awhile against the closed
door, and she crept slowly and unsteadily up the passage, keeping
her hand on the wall for support.&nbsp; Presently she was peering
into the darkened shop; listening, also.&nbsp; Ere long her
brother&rsquo;s voice came indistinctly from the post office
beyond; she gathered that he was checking figures with the
assistant.&nbsp; Rachel appeared to nerve herself, <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>then
stepped stealthily into the shop.&nbsp; On a nail in the wall,
just behind the door, she hung a ponderous key&mdash;the spare
key of the mill, which had been idle that day for the first time
in several weeks.&nbsp; For fully a minute she stood motionless
save for her breathing, her hand pressed hard to her heart; then,
with a heavy sigh, she stole out and laboriously ascended to her
room.&nbsp; She was wholly spent as she fell upon her bed, yet at
the end of an hour she was down in the kitchen preparing the
evening meal, to which her brother would come when he had
finished with the inward evening mail.</p>
<p>Of late John Corrie&rsquo;s appetite had been indifferent;
to-night it seemed to have failed him altogether.&nbsp; He sat
there speechless, now and then taking a sup of tea, and never
once allowing his gaze to fall on his sister&mdash;not that she,
poor soul, could have met it for an instant.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
at last she forced herself to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can ye no&rsquo; eat, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me be.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her eyes on the cloth she said in a strange gentleness of
tone: &ldquo;John, dinna trouble over much.&nbsp; Maybe
everything &rsquo;ll come right yet.&nbsp; Dinna be vexed
wi&rsquo; me, but I believe&mdash;John, I <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>believe
that if ye took pen now and wrote to Kitty, telling her the
truth&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped short, so dreadful was his
expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that be,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;or ye&rsquo;ll
drive me stark mad.&nbsp; Peace!&mdash;no&rsquo; another
word!&rdquo;&nbsp; He got up and strode from the room.</p>
<p>In his pocket was a letter, the postmark on which would have
told that it had been posted in London about midnight; a letter
which he had been expecting for days, consisting of one pencilled
word&mdash;&ldquo;Arrested&rdquo;&mdash;with neither address nor
signature.&nbsp; And by that solitary word Corrie&rsquo;s soul
was racked, as between a man&rsquo;s last hope and his final
terror.</p>
<p>Alone, Rachel put her hand to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh God,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;if only it had been
possible. . . .&nbsp; But now the candle mun be left to
burn&mdash;burn to the end. . . .&nbsp; Maybe&mdash;oh,
surely&mdash;I&rsquo;ll save him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her methodical way she cleared the table, washed the
dishes, and set the kitchen in order.&nbsp; Afterwards she sat by
the fire and tried to read the morning&rsquo;s paper.&nbsp; She
noticed that on the previous day Zeniths had risen to &pound;6,
but the sensational advance moved her not at all.&nbsp; Long
after she had ceased to read she kept staring at the printed
page.&nbsp; At seven o&rsquo;clock, feeling her <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>strength
ebbing, and knowing how vital it was that she should conserve
every spark of energy in her, she went up to her room and lay
down.&nbsp; There was still another hour, possibly more, to wait
and endure. . . .</p>
<p>At last&mdash;at last the sound of running and excited shouts
. . . a thundering on the door below . . . the opening of the
door&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corrie, the mill&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause that seemed an age, then her brother&rsquo;s voice,
harsh, yet almost calm&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rachel, the mill&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; she tried to call, producing
naught but a croak.</p>
<p>She got to the window in time to see him hastening away in the
failing light.&nbsp; She made no attempt to follow just
then.&nbsp; She lingered, crouching there behind the curtain,
until the heavy silence informed her that practically the whole
population of Dunford had bolted to the scene of
destruction.&nbsp; Then body and wits under control once more,
she took the implements she had prepared, cloaked herself and set
out on the road to the mill.&nbsp; Not a soul was in sight.</p>
<p>Her destination was the White Farm.&nbsp; At the door she
knocked, ready to plead faintness should the unexpected
happen.&nbsp; But no one came.&nbsp; She <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>had gauged
pretty accurately the duty sense of housekeeper and servants in
the master&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; One and all had incontinently
deserted the place and their occupations to see the fire she had
raised.&nbsp; A chained dog barked wildly; she did not appear to
hear it.</p>
<p>The door was not locked.&nbsp; She entered and without
hesitation climbed the stair.&nbsp; She had been welcome in the
house in the old and happier days of Symington&rsquo;s
parents.&nbsp; She had often seen the strong box in its original
place in the sitting-room.&nbsp; Doubtless it was upstairs.&nbsp;
She was counting on that.&nbsp; If he had lately got a safe she
had burned the mill to no purpose. . . .&nbsp; But God would not
let her be cheated so, for was it not all done for her
brother&rsquo;s salvation? . . .</p>
<p>And now she was in the apartment above the sitting-room.&nbsp;
The light was very dim, but she soon found what she sought.&nbsp;
In a moment the chintz cover was off and laid aside.&nbsp; Then
in a sort of splendid fury, with heavy, powerful tools, she
attacked the lock, wrenching, twisting, thrusting, driving,
heedless of the attendant noise.</p>
<p>And at last the mauled and shattered thing gave.&nbsp; With a
fierce blow of hammer on sturdy screw-driver she drove it
inwards.&nbsp; The heavy lid yielded.&nbsp; The bundle of Zenith
certificates <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>were there for her to take.&nbsp; She hid them in her
dress. . . .</p>
<p>She swept up the smallest trace of her work, closed the lid,
and neatly replaced the chintz cover.&nbsp; There would be no
discovery till Symington himself made it.&nbsp; As she left the
house she glimpsed, away to the left, a smoky glow, over the
hollow that hid the mill.&nbsp; Without a second glance she set
out for home along the still deserted road.</p>
<p>Having bolted the cottage door and returned the tools to their
place, she sat down to examine her prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel has parted wi&rsquo; 500 shares!&rdquo;
she muttered after a careful recount of the certificates.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Poor John, it was an evil day when ye let Alec Symington
into this house.&nbsp; But Kitty &rsquo;ll forgive ye a tenth
part o&rsquo; her fortune&mdash;if she doesna, I&rsquo;ll offer
her every penny I possess.&nbsp; Oh, John, I think I&rsquo;ve
saved ye; and some day I&rsquo;ll confess to ye about the
mill.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never regret it. . . .&nbsp; But
what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had become conscious of a folded paper, unlike in texture
the certificates, lying on her lap.&nbsp; She must have
inadvertently picked it from the strong box along with the
bundle.&nbsp; It was endorsed &ldquo;Lease of House at 73 Lester
Road, <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>Richmond, Surrey.&rdquo;&nbsp; She opened it and read.
. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s got a house at that place,&rdquo; she
reflected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; my
business.&nbsp; I wonder if John kens.&nbsp; Likely no. . .
.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to try to put it back in the
box&mdash;no! I&rsquo;ll risk nothing for that scoundrel&rsquo;s
sake!&nbsp; He can want his lease!&rdquo;&nbsp; She made to toss
it into the fire, then drew back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it
in the meantime along wi&rsquo; the shares till the time comes
for telling John. . . .&nbsp; The sooner they&rsquo;re hid the
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; She rose, and stood wavering.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, God, but I&rsquo;m weak,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Help me to win through.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>It was late when her brother came in, begrimed and
drenched.&nbsp; She had a meal all but ready for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, John,&rdquo; she said, as he came to
the fire in dry garments.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldna
gang&mdash;couldna bear to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye would ha&rsquo; seen a grand blaze,&rdquo; he
returned bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
left&mdash;new machinery and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; she said soothingly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a fine thing an insurance policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fine&mdash;when ye&rsquo;ve paid the
premium.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>Stopping short in her hospitable task, she stared at
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But ye ha&rsquo; paid it a month
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? . . .&nbsp; The days o&rsquo; grace were up
three weeks back, but&mdash;but I had&mdash;ower many other
things to think about.&rdquo;&nbsp; A groan burst from him, he
put his hands to his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three thousand pound gone
up in three hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s mouth opened, but she was dumb.&nbsp; As if
frozen she stood there by the table, a plate of cut bread in her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he went on heavily, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
take my oath it was no accident, for the place where the fire
started&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a strangled cry the woman tottered and fell crashing
across the table.</p>
<p>Ghastly, Corrie sprang to her assistance.&nbsp; Stumblingly he
carried her to his chair by the hearth.&nbsp; She was not
unconscious; her collapse had been mainly physical.&nbsp; Blood
was dropping from a gash in her wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna heed me,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be all right in a minute, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fetched water and cloths, knelt, washed the wound and
bandaged it awkwardly yet with some tenderness.&nbsp; Slow tears
ran down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I hurting ye, Rachel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>She
shook her head.</p>
<p>He spoke again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldna ha&rsquo; told ye so
quick about the insurance.&nbsp; Dinna keep thinking on
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then with obviously a great
effort&mdash;&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve been a good sister to me,
Rachel.&nbsp; I&mdash;I wish I had been a better
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words left her speechless.&nbsp; What had come to him?</p>
<p>He answered the unspoken question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money&rsquo;s no everything, after all,&rdquo; he said
hoarsely, shamefacedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I saw ye fall I thought
ye were killed&mdash;thought I had killed ye&mdash;wi&rsquo; ma
tongue.&nbsp; And&mdash;and just for an instant I saw myself
without ye&mdash;alone&mdash;in this house&mdash;in this
place&mdash;in the whole world.&nbsp; I had never thought
o&rsquo; it that way before.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sighed, and got to
his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll say no more about it, Rachel,
but I&rsquo;ll try to treat ye better from now.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
cleared his throat, and averting his gaze said: &ldquo;I wish I
had never set eyes on Symington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel restrained herself then, not for her own sake, but for
his.&nbsp; For his own safety he must not know her secret a
moment before the time was ripe.&nbsp; Moreover, though his kind
words had moved her deeply, they had not healed her wounded trust
in him.</p>
<p>All she could say was: &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll aye find me <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>ready and
willing to help ye, John; and it&rsquo;s never too
late&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sighed again heavily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But things mun take their course now. . . .&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;d better gang to your bed, or ye&rsquo;ll be useless in
the morning, and I&rsquo;ve got to be early at the mill.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll get my supper myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went without a word.</p>
<p>Corrie sank into his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almighty!&rdquo; he moaned to himself, &ldquo;what
devil started me speculating on the Stock Exchange? . . .&nbsp;
Gone, the savings o&rsquo; a lifetime! . . .&nbsp; And now the
mill that would ha&rsquo; sold for enough to save me and maybe my
savings likewise&mdash;in ashes&mdash;just ashes!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s ruin, black ruin, unless Symington does all he&rsquo;s
promised. . . .&nbsp; And the postman&rsquo;s getting better! . .
.&nbsp; God! I&rsquo;d write to Kitty this night, if it wasna too
late&mdash;but now I&rsquo;m damned in her eyes for ever and
ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Small wonder if it were indeed so!</p>
<p>In the study at Aberdare Mansions, Colin, very pale, sat
staring at a sheet of typewritten paper, which Risk had put into
his hand, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister, as I&rsquo;ve already explained, found this
on her return to the flat.&nbsp; Steady, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>On
the sheet was written, in apparent haste, the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Hilda,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A detective has come to arrest me.&nbsp; He says
it&rsquo;s the Post Office.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid,
only sorry to trouble you so.&nbsp; Sam will see me
through.&nbsp; Good-bye for a little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> was not a little excited at
the prospect of her trip with Hilda, though at first her pride
had raised a difficulty, and she had begged to be allowed to pay
her own expenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Hilda had promptly rejoined,
&ldquo;if you wish to hurt my brother&rsquo;s feelings, not to
mention mine, I can&rsquo;t prevent you.&nbsp; Besides, you will
spoil my holiday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Hilda, I can&rsquo;t be always
taking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have your revenge when the play is making your
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it will. . . .&nbsp; Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad
Mr. West is going to be reasonable, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out and buy things for our
holiday,&rdquo; Hilda had said, rather hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
have no time to waste to-day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a nuisance, but
I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have to go to the office for an hour
to-night, so that I may leave things in shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I must finish that typing before I go to <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>bed.&nbsp;
Oh, Hilda, sometimes I can&rsquo;t help feeling that it&rsquo;s
all a dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;the typing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the wonderful things that have happened to me
lately.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s not a month since that horrible
time in Dunford.&nbsp; I only wish for one thing&mdash;to hear
from Sam, the postman.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t understand his not
writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, Mr. Hayward, who has gone to Scotland, my
brother&rsquo;s note tells me, will have news.&nbsp; I am wiring
him to take tea with us at Newcastle to-morrow
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, naturally, I want to look my best!&nbsp; So come
along to the shops at once!&nbsp; By the way, we have dinner
early to-night&mdash;Matilda&rsquo;s evening at the picture
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>It was now shortly after eight.&nbsp; Hilda had not been long
gone to the office, after promising to return by ten and wishing,
secretly, that she had asked Matilda to postpone her
outing.&nbsp; But her casual suggestion in that direction had
been scoffed at by Kitty; and to have carried it further would
only have made the girl uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Kitty was too absorbed to feel lonely.&nbsp; Under the shaded
electric light she was making an effort <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>to finish
her typing before Hilda&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; She was in the best
of spirits that youth and health can supply, and she was looking
forward eagerly to the morrow&mdash;and, perhaps, the
morrow&rsquo;s afternoon.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she did start when a bell in the distance purred
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; she called herself the next
moment.&nbsp; It was just the hour for the postman, and probably
he had a packet that would not go into the letter-box.&nbsp; She
went at once to the door.</p>
<p>A thick-set man of middle age, heavily moustached, but not
unpleasantly featured, in dark tweeds and bowler hat,
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Miss Kitty Carstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could answer, he was standing beside her and the
door was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to say to you, Miss Carstairs,&rdquo;
he proceeded in a quiet voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you ought to
sit down to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some seconds the girl was incapable of speech and
action.&nbsp; But her mind was working, and it perceived that she
gained no advantage by remaining in the confined space of the
little passage.&nbsp; In silence she led the way to the
sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you and what do you want with <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>me?&rdquo;
she managed to say, taking her stand with the table between
them.&nbsp; She began to suspect that he was a messenger from
Symington, but there was something &ldquo;decent&rdquo; about his
face that reassured her.</p>
<p>His reply was certainly unexpected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a detective, and I hold a warrant for your
arrest.&nbsp; I have to warn you that anything you may say now
may be used against you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty went white, but it was with anger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; she demanded at last, &ldquo;has dared to do
such a thing?&nbsp; Who desires my arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The warrant is issued at the instance of the
Postmaster-General&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! . . .&nbsp; I see! I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carstairs.&nbsp; I warn you
again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does all this mean that I have got to go with
you&mdash;now&mdash;to the police office?&rdquo;&nbsp; To herself
she was saying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a coward!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my duty to take you there,&rdquo; the man
answered, &ldquo;and I hope you will not make it harder for me
than you can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His respectful tone stayed the sinking of her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I send a message to a friend?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>&ldquo;You might leave a short note.&nbsp; I&mdash;I
think,&rdquo; he said almost nervously, &ldquo;I can allow you
five minutes&mdash;not more&mdash;to write it and put a few
things together.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wiped his forehead, though the
window was open and the room cool.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;
he went on quickly, noticing her look of dismay, &ldquo;you may
not be detained long.&nbsp; No doubt your friends will arrange
for bail.&nbsp; But now&mdash;please&mdash;I must ask you to make
haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can answer no more questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently there was nothing for it but to submit.&nbsp; She
sat down, scribbled the brief note that we have seen, and
rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed her as far as the outer door, where he mounted
guard, as it were.</p>
<p>Within five minutes she rejoined him, dressed for out of
doors, a small travelling bag in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get it over,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a brave young lady,&rdquo; he remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Allow me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He relieved her of the bag.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A very brave young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing to make me afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his fingers on the door handle, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me your word to&mdash;to come with me
quietly?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>Her
head went up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door and stood aside for her to pass out.&nbsp;
Now there was no doubt about his nervousness; he was paler than
she.</p>
<p>She went steadily before him down the narrow wooden
stairway.&nbsp; On the landing he overtook her, and they
continued their descent on the broader stone steps, passing
business offices closed for the night.</p>
<p>At the entrance a plain-looking motor brougham was
waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will remember, Miss Carstairs,&rdquo; he
whispered, &ldquo;that I used no harshness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;thank you.&nbsp; Have we far to
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a longish drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they crossed the pavement Kitty thought it strange that no
one stared, then almost laughed at the stupidity of the
notion.&nbsp; Why should any one stare?&nbsp; Truly the man was
behaving very nicely.</p>
<p>He opened the door, followed her into the brougham, and closed
it with a bang.&nbsp; The brougham immediately rolled away.&nbsp;
The man took the narrow seat opposite, and she heard him draw a
long breath.</p>
<p>She tried to baulk the returning fears.&nbsp; Anger <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>at her
uncle assisted her to some extent.&nbsp; He must have gone quite
mad!&nbsp; And then a dreadful thought struck and almost stunned
her spirits.&nbsp; Suppose something had happened to Sam!&nbsp;
Suppose he were&mdash;dead! . . .</p>
<p>Time passed ere she recovered her wits and courage.&nbsp; Her
aunt knew the truth, and Kitty could not believe that Rachel
Corrie, even for her brother&rsquo;s sake, would fall to
perjury.&nbsp; And there was Mr. Risk, and Hilda, and Mr. West,
and&mdash;Colin!&nbsp; Oh, with such friends, why should she be
afraid?&nbsp; No doubt she was in for a most disagreeable ordeal;
but it was bound to end in her complete triumph. . . .&nbsp;
Well, she was having an adventure, and no mistake!&nbsp;
Adventures!&mdash;how lightly she had uttered the word in the
past to Colin!&nbsp; How gently he had treated her foolish
talk!&nbsp; Her mind went back to that night in the little wood
at Dunford, when she had let him kiss her.&nbsp; Then his
prospects and hers had been simply blank.&nbsp; Now . . . but
what had made her allow him to kiss her?</p>
<p>She came out of a long reflection.&nbsp; Indeed, the
destination was evidently a far one! She had not noticed the
course taken by the brougham&mdash;not that she could have
recognized any streets other than one or two of the main west end
<a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>thoroughfares.&nbsp; It seemed to her now that they
must be somewhere in the suburbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we nearly there?&rdquo; she asked her guardian.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still a bit to go,&rdquo;
he said, and gave a long, vague explanation, which she could not
follow, as to police districts and other matters.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
work ends,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;when I have handed you
over to the&mdash;the chief inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of asking him what the chief inspector was like,
and whether she would have to go to Scotland, but suddenly she
felt too tired to talk.&nbsp; The reaction had come, and she lay
back exhaustedly, with the tears not far away.&nbsp; She was no
longer in a hurry to reach the destination.</p>
<p>The man drew down the blinds.&nbsp; Soon the speed of the
brougham was increased; it seemed to be travelling over a
different sort of road.&nbsp; There were occasional ruts that
suggested the country.</p>
<p>At the end of what seemed a very long, yet too short period,
the man said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are practically there now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And under
his breath he added: &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brougham lurched round a corner; presently its pace
slackened.</p>
<p>The man drew up the blind on the left, and, <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>the moment
the motion ceased, threw open the door and jumped out, laying her
bag on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you get out, please?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; His
voice had become husky and fearful.</p>
<p>She obeyed and looked about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely this is not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speech failed as the man, with a whispered
&ldquo;Forgive,&rdquo; sprang into the brougham, which
immediately started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; groaned the man, &ldquo;to think
I&rsquo;ve lived to be driven to this for the sake of twenty
pounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty found herself standing on the earthen foot-walk of a
badly-lighted road, in front of an iron gate, open, with a
shrub-bordered path leading to a large, dark house.&nbsp; That
was all she had grasped when some one sprang upon her, a heavy
shawl was thrown over her head and face, and&mdash;her senses
failed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>She came to herself, lying on a couch in a large room with a
low ceiling which, like the walls, had been whitewashed but
lately, for there were dampish patches here and there.&nbsp; The
floor was of stone flags, but its bareness was partly covered by
Turkey rugs.&nbsp; There were no windows, unless <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>one cared
to give the name to a couple of oblong openings protected by
gratings close to the roof.&nbsp; Two electric bulbs, which with
their wires, had evidently been hurriedly installed, depended
from the ceiling; an electric heater glowed in a niche in one of
the walls.&nbsp; Across one of the corners a curtain had been
hung on a wire, and being only partially drawn, permitted a
glimpse of a small white bed, a white dressing-table and a white
wash-stand.</p>
<p>Near the centre of the room was a round table covered with a
new cloth and decorated with two pairs of silver flower-vases
containing carnations.&nbsp; A middle-aged woman was engaged in
putting the finishing touches to a meal consisting of a cold
chicken, sliced ham, salad, bread and butter, and so forth, also
a small bottle of champagne and a syphon of lemonade.</p>
<p>Kitty sat up, but was still too dazed to notice the
incongruities.&nbsp; She saw only a woman&rsquo;s back and the
white walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they put me in prison?&rdquo; she asked
faintly.</p>
<p>The woman turned a red, expressionless face, and
answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, Miss.&nbsp; But your supper&rsquo;s ready.&nbsp;
Kindly ring if you want anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>&ldquo;I want to see the&mdash;the inspector,&rdquo;
said the girl, still groping in a mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&nbsp; To-morrow, maybe.&nbsp; Your
bed&rsquo;s ready when you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went out.</p>
<p>Kitty pressed her palms to her temples, and with eyes closed
remained motionless for several minutes.&nbsp; Then, with a sigh,
she took courage to look about her.</p>
<p>It was well that she had a healthy heart, for at the
realization of her surroundings a weakly one must surely have
stopped.</p>
<h2><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the study Colin rose to his
feet, a prey to distress and wrath.&nbsp; Kitty&rsquo;s message
fluttered in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better take the midnight train,&rdquo; he said,
striving for control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what end?&rdquo; Risk gently asked, while Hilda, who
looked worn-out, took a step forward as if to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To compel that blackguard Corrie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please sit down again, Hayward,&rdquo; Risk said,
enforcing his words with a mild pressure.&nbsp; &ldquo;As far as
we can see it at the moment, Corrie had no direct hand in the
outrage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has got the Post Office authorities to
act&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The post office people had nothing to do with it.&nbsp;
Pull yourself together, man!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to give you a
shock. . .&nbsp; You tell him, Hilda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hayward,&rdquo; she said, pityingly, &ldquo;the
person who took Kitty away was merely <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>masquerading as a detective.&nbsp;
He had nothing to do with the police or the Post Office.&nbsp; My
brother learned that much within a few minutes after my giving
him the alarm. . . .&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t let this crush
you.&nbsp; We want your help, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hilda had a
way of striking the right note.</p>
<p>Colin got a grip on himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Symington, of
course,&rdquo; he said, steadying his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course!&rdquo; she assented bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I went out and left her alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; said Risk, &ldquo;Symington
did not move from his hotel after eight o&rsquo;clock last night,
and he went North by the mail train at five this morning.&nbsp;
That does not prove his innocence; on the other hand, it does not
help to prove the other thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have set the police to work?&rdquo; said Colin
sharply.&nbsp; At that moment he hated Risk.&nbsp; Why on earth
had not the man held up Symington the moment he doubted the
latter&rsquo;s right to the Zeniths?&nbsp; Why had he insisted on
making a &ldquo;game&rdquo; of it all? . . .&nbsp; But the
feeling passed.&nbsp; He knew too well that Risk had been as
sincerely anxious to shield Kitty from anything sordid and ugly
as he had been eager to serve her material interests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Risk mildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>supercilious feelings about the methods of our police,
but for Miss Carstairs&rsquo; own sake we want publicity less
than ever now.&nbsp; I have eight men at work, who will do all
that Scotland Yard could do&mdash;and I am not resting much
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin thought for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowing what we
do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t need to look far for a
motive on Symington&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; The Zeniths
alone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty will never give in,&rdquo; cried Hilda.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never force her to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; groaned Colin, &ldquo;to think of her
being in that scoundrel&rsquo;s power!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk laid a hand on his shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blame me, if
you must, Hayward,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t
give way to despair.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a slight pause he added:
&ldquo;Give me four days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite&mdash;only the means, I hope, of obtaining
one.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t ask me questions.&nbsp; My plan may be
unnecessary after all.&nbsp; We may perhaps find the way without
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Risk, can&rsquo;t you put your plan into
operation at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It requires some developing. . . .&nbsp; For
Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Hayward,&rdquo; exclaimed Risk, with
unwonted warmth, &ldquo;try to believe that I&rsquo;d give <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>all I have
if I could get the poor girl out of that cad&rsquo;s clutches
without an hour&rsquo;s delay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will trust my brother, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Hilda softly, and next moment Colin was silently wringing
Risk&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Somehow, he could not doubt this
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what can I do?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though it may seem out of place, I want you now to tell
me the results of your journey.&nbsp; Also let me have the films
you exposed.&nbsp; By the way,&rdquo; Risk went on, &ldquo;West
has got a week&rsquo;s leave, and is going to spend a few days in
the neighbourhood of Dunford.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s unknown there, and
another flying visit from you might seem more than odd to some
people&mdash;besides, I want you here.&nbsp; Only, I&rsquo;d like
you to see West before he starts by the midnight train&mdash;you
may be able to give him some hints about the district, and so
on.&nbsp; Therefore, we&rsquo;ll get on with our talk, and you
can be over at Euston soon after 11.30.&nbsp; He expects
you.&nbsp; He would have come here, but he had an appointment
with the manager of the Planet Theatre&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; put in Hilda, &ldquo;we are so sure of
having Kitty with us again, almost immediately, that the play is
going forward as if nothing had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>It is
to be feared that Colin did not find much comfort in the remark,
but at least it reminded him once more that a cool head was then
of greater value to Kitty&rsquo;s cause than all the warm hearts
in the world.</p>
<p>Though he could not have stated why, he was feeling a little
less cheerless when he left Aberdare Mansions for the meeting
with West.&nbsp; He was noting in his mind certain suggestions
which he thought might be of use to his friend, and
absentmindedly looking out for a taxi-cab, when one appeared and
came to the pavement in response to his signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Euston,&rdquo; he said and got in.</p>
<p>But as he was about to draw to the door, a hand was laid on it
and a voice requested the driver to &ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; continued the voice, which belonged
to a shabby, genteel, sharp-featured young man, &ldquo;but I
think you are Mr. Colin Hayward.&rdquo;&nbsp; An uncleanly hand
presented an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; muttered Colin, then seized
it with a start.&nbsp; It was the covering of a note he had sent
Kitty a week ago.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a barred window,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp;
<a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&ldquo;The lady told me what you were like, and where
I&rsquo;d be likely to find you&mdash;this isn&rsquo;t the first
place I&rsquo;ve tried&mdash;and she gave me a sovereign, and she
said you would be sure to give me another, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; An
unclean palm slid forward hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; cried Colin, his heart thumping,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no message written here!&nbsp; Have you
lost&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady said she had nothing to write with, but she
said you would surely understand and come quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin drew a long breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is&mdash;the
barred window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme the sovereign, please, and I&rsquo;ll show
you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you five sovereigns when you&rsquo;ve
shown me!&rdquo; said Colin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell the man where to
go and get inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not forgotten about West, and Risk was still in his
mind, but they suddenly ceased to matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far?&rdquo; he inquired, as the cab started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten minutes from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of place is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respectable&mdash;oh, quite respectable, but not the
sort of place a gentleman like you would fancy to live in,
sir.&nbsp; First time I was ever there, <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>too.&nbsp;
Just taking a stroll, wondering where I was going to get my next
meal, when I heard a female cry from an area, and looking down I
saw a hand moving at a window, a few inches open, behind
bars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; Look here, I may require your
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, sir&mdash;when I&rsquo;ve touched that
fiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it now.&rdquo;&nbsp; A bank-note rustled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real gentleman!&nbsp; Thank &rsquo;ee,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before long the cab left familiar thoroughfares, and began a
journey through a succession of more or less mean streets.&nbsp;
In reply to Colin&rsquo;s questions his companion named some of
them, without, however, making Colin much the wiser.&nbsp; But
what mattered it whither he was going so long as it was to
Kitty?&nbsp; His heart was wild with anticipation; his hand
trembled on the crushed envelope that she had so lately
touched.&nbsp; He had no fear of not being able to rescue
her.&nbsp; If necessary he would request police assistance, but
he did not expect to have to go that length.&nbsp; People who
abducted girls, or took temporary charge of them, were not the
sort to wait for the police.&nbsp; Colin, too, had a fairly heavy
stick which Sharp had put into his hand as he left the
flat.&nbsp; Certainly he was not afraid.&nbsp; He looked at his
watch.&nbsp; <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>Why, he might not only rescue Kitty, but manage to
catch West at Euston also!&nbsp; As for Symington and Corrie. . .
.&nbsp; The shabby-genteel young man began to talk earnestly.</p>
<p>The cab stopped at a corner.&nbsp; The guide got out and
walked slowly down a narrow pavement, in front of houses that
still wore an air of respectability, dingy indeed, and decaying,
but not to be wholly suppressed.&nbsp; The long street was
indifferently lighted and void of traffic.</p>
<p>Colin paid the driver and followed.&nbsp; By arrangement he
did not overtake his guide, but watched him for a signal.</p>
<p>They were half-way down the street when the leader threw out
his left arm.&nbsp; Colin marked the position; and on reaching it
found a gateless space in the railing leading to a steep and
narrow flight of steps.&nbsp; He paused for a moment, noted the
second low window on his right, which showed a very faint glimmer
behind its bars and blind, looked again to make sure that his
guide had halted within call, as agreed, and with a wave of his
hand, and grasping his stick, began cautiously to descend into
the darkness.&nbsp; A moment later he was tapping discreetly on
the window, and then&mdash;</p>
<p>He was seized from behind, thrown backwards <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>and
downwards, into, as it seemed, an atmosphere of chloroform.&nbsp;
The last distinct sounds he heard were the pants of a motor and a
strange voice saying, &ldquo;Hurry up, there&rsquo;s the
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>At five minutes before midnight Anthony West rushed from the
train to a telephone box and rang up Risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colin hasn&rsquo;t turned up,&rdquo; he said, without
preamble.</p>
<p>For the first time Miss Risk heard her brother swear.&nbsp;
But he did it without losing his calmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must go on, Anthony, and carry out the
programme as well as you can,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must use your own discretion a little more; that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t lose your train.&nbsp; Accidents will
happen.&nbsp; Good luck to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver, and turned to his sister, his face
expressing grave concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hayward has not arrived at Euston.&nbsp; Of course, he
may have met with an accident&mdash;but now I could almost bet
that Symington did not really go North this morning&mdash;or
rather, he turned back before he had gone far.&nbsp; I ought to
have given the beggar credit for more cunning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda considered before she asked: &ldquo;But why <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>in the
world should Symington want to harm him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be several reasons.&nbsp; Perhaps I ought to
tell you where Hayward disappeared that night you and Miss
Carstairs were dining here.&nbsp; He went to Symington&rsquo;s
hotel, and gave the rascal a sound thrashing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but indiscreet.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sighed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; Cad as he is, I could almost
trust Symington not to maltreat the girl, but. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;
He returned to the telephone and rang up a police station on the
route that a cab would naturally take to Euston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he would never dare,&rdquo; began Hilda, and
stopped short, remembering Symington&rsquo;s face as she had seen
it that night in the train.&nbsp; Cruel&mdash;that was the
word&mdash;the face of a man who would inflict torture to gain
his end.</p>
<p>Risk had hit on the truth, Symington had not gone far North
that morning.&nbsp; As a matter of fact he had left the train at
Rugby, entered a powerful motor-car, and came South
again&mdash;not to the Kingsway Grand Hotel, but to a rather
dilapidated mansion situated at 336 Lester Road, Richmond.</p>

<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>At
Dunford on the following evening, John Corrie found among the
letters from the South one for himself.&nbsp; For the second time
he gazed at a single pencilled
word&mdash;&ldquo;Arrested&rdquo;&mdash;and shuddered
&rsquo;twixt terror and hope.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s nerves seemed
to be in rags, for he paled, started violently, and dropped the
letter when the door of the post office opened.</p>
<p>But it was only a tourist who entered.&nbsp; Corrie&rsquo;s
whole being bounded up in relief&mdash;only to drop sickeningly
at the stranger&rsquo;s first words&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see Miss Kitty Carstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> woman with the red,
expressionless face put her head into Kitty&rsquo;s prison and
said&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve to tell ye that he&rsquo;ll be
coming to see you in five minutes from now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without
waiting for a response she closed the door and shot the bolt.</p>
<p>Kitty was seated on the couch with a book in her hand.&nbsp;
She had actually managed to read a little, though it is highly
probable that she could not have told very clearly what the pages
had been about.&nbsp; Yet the fact that she had been able to fix
her attention on a mere story for the space of a couple of hours
proved that she had regained a fair command over her wits, and
recovered at least something of her courage.&nbsp; At all events,
of the panic of twenty-four hours ago little trace
remained.&nbsp; She was pale, but it was the pallor of anxiety,
not terror; and now, at the woman&rsquo;s announcement, the
apprehension in her fine eyes was counterbalanced by a determined
firming of her pretty, sensitive mouth.</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&ldquo;He can do nothing, after all,&rdquo; she assured
herself, &ldquo;and it won&rsquo;t be very long till they find
out where I am.&nbsp; I must show him I&rsquo;m not afraid of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was past midnight, but she felt no weariness, for she had
slept through the afternoon.&nbsp; She was, in fact, feeling as
well as ever she had felt.&nbsp; Just after the first horrid
realization of her situation she had made up her mind to starve
rather than accept of his hospitality; but soon she had perceived
the absurdity of such a course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, be as sensible as you
can,&rdquo; she commanded herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
to keep fit and healthy, for you don&rsquo;t know what you may
have to do with your strength.&nbsp; And the food is of the best,
perfectly cooked and beautifully served.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t try
to pose as a persecuted heroine on the stage.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
been fearfully lucky, and this is only going to be a nasty little
episode, which you&rsquo;ll laugh at before long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the same, she had a breakdown or two in spite of her brave
words, and the time had passed very, very slowly.&nbsp; Now as
she heard his step at the door, she moved herself to play a
part.</p>
<p>Symington entered, closing the door behind him.&nbsp; He was
in evening dress and cut a handsome figure in his way.&nbsp; His
countenance was somewhat <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>flushed; his eyes glistened rather
unpleasantly.&nbsp; For various reasons he had delayed visiting
his prisoner until now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I could not come to see you sooner,
Kitty,&rdquo; he said, halting by the flower-decorated table, and
resting his hand on the back of a chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
room,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is not what I would have chosen
for your reception, but it was the best I could do in the
time.&nbsp; I have a fine house upstairs being prepared
for&mdash;us.&nbsp; Still, I hope you have been fairly
comfortable.&nbsp; You have only to ask for anything you
want.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused, watching her.</p>
<p>Her eyes had never left the book; she appeared oblivious of
his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you kindly tell me
if there is anything I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go away,&rdquo; she answered quietly, without
moving.</p>
<p>He had prepared himself for an unkind reception.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is something you must hear before I go,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, Kitty, don&rsquo;t trouble to try to make
me lose my temper, because I&rsquo;m not going to oblige you in
that way.&nbsp; In any other way, you have only to
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you must talk, please leave my name
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>After
a slight pause he said: &ldquo;Would you mind putting down your
book for a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lowered it, her finger at the place, and faced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no question to ask me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are great!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
have a question to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her hand to her mouth and gave a little yawn.&nbsp;
His colour deepened, but he spoke calmly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon will you marry me, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was cruelty in her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Symington,
how far do you intend to go with this idiotic
business?&rdquo;&nbsp; She threw a significant glance around the
room.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must have cost you a good deal of money so
far&mdash;and all for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He winced, but kept himself in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I will never marry you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She made
to resume her book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you shall!&rdquo;&nbsp; He moved quickly
and stood over her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that you are
in my power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m under lock and key, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t force me to tell you what I
mean.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d far rather have your promise without that.
. . .&nbsp; Kitty, listen!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t deny that you
know I&rsquo;m desperately fond of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; His words
came swiftly now.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t deny that
I&rsquo;m aware you don&rsquo;t even like me.&nbsp; But just as
you could make what you please of me, I believe in time, I
could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must hear me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a rich man, though
hardly anybody knows it.&nbsp; I can offer you a splendid
life&mdash;give you things you&rsquo;ve never dreamed of, take
you abroad, make you a home wherever you desire. . . .&nbsp;
Kitty, I confess I&rsquo;ve done lots to be ashamed of in my
time, but I swear I&rsquo;ll make you a good
husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do stop!&rdquo; she said, her calm broken.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can you&mdash;how dare you&mdash;talk so after all you
have done&mdash;the abominable things you have done to me? . .
.&nbsp; Rich?&nbsp; What should I care if you had all the money
in the world?&nbsp; Why, I shouldn&rsquo;t care enough to ask how
you had got it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand fell on her shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo;
he said in tense tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;For as surely as I am
touching you now you are going to marry me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>She
shook off his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you touch me
again&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was almost a sneer.&nbsp; Next
moment he said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Kitty.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not that sort.&nbsp; You&mdash;you&rsquo;re sacred. . .
.&nbsp; But you do not leave this place until we go out of it
together to be married.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think you can escape,
and don&rsquo;t imagine it will be so very long till you give
in.&nbsp; Your friends may find their way here some day, but they
won&rsquo;t be in time.&nbsp; Afterwards&mdash;what will your
friends matter?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be my wife, and no one shall
dare come between us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; she exclaimed, clinging to her
courage.&nbsp; &ldquo;For your own sake give up this crazy
notion.&nbsp; Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be dreadfully
punished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a short laugh he moved away a few paces, then faced her
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deliberately won&rsquo;t understand my love for
you, Kitty, and you don&rsquo;t understand my power&mdash;as
yet.&nbsp; For your own sake, and another&rsquo;s, I beg you once
more to give in without forcing me to use&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what is the good of all this talk?&nbsp; You can
make things uncomfortable for me for a few days, perhaps, but you
can never compel me to <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>do the most hateful thing I can
imagine&mdash;in other words, marry you.&nbsp; And that is my
last word, Mr. Symington.&rdquo;&nbsp; She took up her book and
opened it, but her fingers trembled on the page.</p>
<p>With difficulty he restrained his passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said a little thickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but you force me on the course I would
have avoided if possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Softly he cleared his
throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll explain.&nbsp; A little while
ago I received a telephone message to the effect that . . .
ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; An electric bell had sounded in
the distance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us wait.&rdquo;&nbsp; He smiled as
he took out his cigarette case, but the fingers that presently
held the match were not much steadier than hers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Listen, listen!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>In spite of herself Kitty listened.&nbsp; At first her ears
could detect nothing; then they heard the closing of a distant,
heavy door.&nbsp; A brief period of silence was followed by the
sound, faint to begin with, of slow, heavy footfalls.&nbsp; Soon
she realized they were descending a stone stair.&nbsp; Nearer
they came, and at last seemed to reach the level.&nbsp; Nearer
still&mdash;they were coming along the passage outside her
door.&nbsp; They rang dully and erratically on the stone
flags.&nbsp; Kitty thought of two men bearing a weighty
burden.&nbsp; <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>As they passed the door she heard voices, gruff and
impatient.</p>
<p>Suddenly Symington gave an odd, triumphant laugh,
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My second prisoner has arrived!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily the girl lifted her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the last time, Kitty, will you give me your word
that you will marry me as soon as I can get&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;You miserable
fool,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned.&nbsp; &ldquo;The more you hurt me, the more I love
you!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use fighting me, Kitty.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
going to win,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;re bound
to give in.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because my second prisoner shall not
get so much as a crust until you give me your word!&nbsp;
Remember, you forced me to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He swung round to the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You coward,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;who is your
second prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without answering he went out.&nbsp; It was as though her wall
of defence had suddenly crumbled into ruins.</p>
<h2><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the third evening following that
of Kitty&rsquo;s disappearance, Risk was reading a letter which
the last post had just brought him.&nbsp; The letter was from
Anthony West, and the important part of it ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have now completed the arrangements
according to your instructions.&nbsp; The town is only twenty
miles from Dunford, and the road between is excellent.&nbsp;
Besides, the moon will oblige on the night appointed.&nbsp; I am
no judge of cars, but think I have engaged the sort you require.
. . .&nbsp; I saw the postman yesterday.&nbsp; He is fairly on
the mend now, but worrying at not hearing from Miss Kitty.&nbsp;
Herewith three snapshots of him, taken while sitting on the
hospital veranda.&nbsp; By the way, I gathered that he would not
seek to lift a finger against Corrie without Kitty&rsquo;s
permission. . . .&nbsp; Corrie is a hard nut.&nbsp; He takes <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>me for a
friend of Kitty&rsquo;s late father, and I have allowed him to
think that my first inquiry was prompted more by a belated sense
of duty than by any real interest in the girl.&nbsp; I dropped
into the post-office about closing time last night, and found him
less disinclined to talk.&nbsp; He said nothing directly against
his niece, merely remarking that in the face of his advice she
had gone to London, where she had friends, and that while she had
not yet written, he hoped he might be able to hand me her address
before long.&nbsp; To extract truth from such a person will take
a bit of doing.&nbsp; The sister, I learn from the gossips, has
been ill, though not seriously so, for the last few days.&nbsp; I
should add that Corrie goes about saying that the burning of his
mill was a piece of foul play.&nbsp; A man told me to-day that it
was not insured. . . .&nbsp; No word of Symington.&nbsp; He has
not been seen in Dunford for more than a week.&nbsp; As far as I
can gather, no one would regret his permanent absence. . .
.&nbsp; I see Zeniths have jumped to &pound;8.&nbsp; Do you still
say they are worth &pound;12?&nbsp; I almost wish I had taken
your advice, and pawned my shirt! . . .&nbsp; Well, I am looking
forward to our meeting here on Thursday with pleasure, not to say
curiosity.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the game, I wonder?&nbsp; But,
perhaps, you will have found <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Kitty and Colin before
then&mdash;God make it so . . . &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Risk laid the letter on the table, placed the snapshots in an
envelope, directed it, and rang for his man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharp, take a taxi and deliver this to Mr. Boon.&nbsp;
Say I&rsquo;m sorry it comes a little late, but that he must get
his men to work harder.&nbsp; Tell him to spare neither men nor
money.&nbsp; There must be no failure to-night.&nbsp; I am going
out presently.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m late, don&rsquo;t wait
up.&nbsp; Pack my bag for one night; include both my
revolvers.&nbsp; Call me at eight; breakfast at nine; and a taxi
for nine-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later Risk was at the flat in Long Acre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do, Hilda,&rdquo; he said
kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to help matters by
breaking down.&nbsp; Have you been out to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I feel now that I daren&rsquo;t leave the
flat in case she should come back&mdash;perhaps with that beast
after her&mdash;poor little soul.&nbsp; Oh, John, I sometimes
think it was all my fault.&nbsp; I should not have left her alone
that night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; If it comes to that, I am to blame, for
I might have foreseen. . . .&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll soon have her
with you again, Hilda!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>&ldquo;Have you news?&rdquo; she cried eagerly.</p>
<p>He gave her West&rsquo;s letter, saying: &ldquo;You can look
at it afterwards.&nbsp; No; I can&rsquo;t say I have news, but in
a few hours I shall be ready to act.&nbsp; That wretched Corrie
shall tell me where his niece and Hayward are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;&nbsp; All at once she put her
hands on his shoulders, and looked searchingly into his
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, John,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t hide it&mdash;you&rsquo;re afraid of
something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said at last with sudden weariness,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next moment he drew himself
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s because, like you, I&rsquo;m
tired out.&nbsp; A few hours&rsquo; sleep will make all the
difference to both of us.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you come back with me
and stay the night?&nbsp; I hate leaving you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I imagine if she came in the
middle of the night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try not to imagine things, my dear.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;ll just spend the night here.&nbsp; This couch will
do.&nbsp; Ask your maid to knock me up at seven.&nbsp; And go
straight off to bed yourself.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you good brother!&rdquo; she cried softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was wondering how I was going to get through another
night alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon she retired, a little more hopeful, and ere long was in a
sleep of sheer exhaustion.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>But
for Risk, wearied as he was, there was scarcely any rest.&nbsp;
He was desperately anxious.&nbsp; He could not conceive of
Symington daring actually to injure the girl; but what if the man
struck at her through his other victim?&nbsp; Risk groaned at the
thought.&nbsp; He went to the window, and threw it wide to the
still, mild night.&nbsp; Ah, it was no longer a game he was
engaged in, but a business most terribly serious, vital to the
future peace of his soul.&nbsp; For he loved&mdash;no need to
deny it to the stars&mdash;he loved Kitty Carstairs . . . and a
lover&rsquo;s insight had informed him that, sooner or later, her
heart would turn to Colin Hayward, who had put faith and trust in
him, who regarded him as benefactor, aye, and true friend.&nbsp;
So he had his honour as well as his love to serve in smashing the
enemy.&nbsp; Yet, had Colin not come to London, what might not
have happened? . . .</p>
<p>At last he tore himself from the night and his sorry dreams,
and lay down, not to sleep, but grimly to rehearse, in minutest
detail, all that he had planned for the morrow.&nbsp; And every
now and then he was interrupted by a Dread.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Another was rehearsing a plan that still, mild night.&nbsp; In
a small room, furnished with odds and <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>ends, sat Symington.&nbsp; The
atmosphere was unpleasant with cigar reek and whisky fumes.&nbsp;
Since his tremendous bout of dissipation the man had somehow
failed to regain the mastery in respect of alcohol.&nbsp; Yet he
was far from being intoxicated.&nbsp; Apart from the plan itself
two things were especially clear to his intelligence.&nbsp;
First, Zeniths had boomed to 8&frac14;; second, he had less than
&pound;20 on hand.&nbsp; It would be necessary to convert another
certificate into cash at the earliest moment possible.&nbsp; He
was tempted to convert them all into cash at the present
magnificent price; only greed to obtain yet more restrained
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing for it,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but to travel
to-morrow night, after. . .&nbsp; Unless&mdash;why, the thing
might be done to-night!&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be a fool and spoil everything by rushing it!&nbsp;
If her mind is not sufficiently prepared, and if he doesn&rsquo;t
look sufficiently&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Breaking off, he rang the
bell at the side of the fireplace.</p>
<p>The woman with the red, expressionless face answered the
summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the lady now?&rdquo; he asked curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleeping at last, but she&rsquo;s restless.&nbsp; I
doubt she won&rsquo;t sleep long.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her pale eyes
avoided his.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t know what you may
be after, Mr. Granton,&rdquo; the hard mouth said slowly, <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>&ldquo;I
take the liberty of warning you not to carry it too
far&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your own business, and clear out.&nbsp; Send your
man to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence intended, but I doubt she hasn&rsquo;t eaten
a bite to-day,&rdquo; said the woman, and went out.&nbsp; Her
humanity was not equal to the grand wages she was getting.</p>
<p>Symington sighed, took a drink and muttered: &ldquo;Poor
Kitty!&nbsp; Perhaps we may get it over to-night, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A huge lout of a man, with a red beard and a bald head,
shuffled in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much change.&nbsp; Looking peaked a bit.&nbsp; But
he made a joke when he said good night.&nbsp; Expect he&rsquo;ll
feel a goodish bit worse by to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington considered.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you go
downstairs,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you will take away the
water and give him none to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; No water, Mr. Granton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but surely that&rsquo;s a bit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to obey or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man lifted his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;All right, Mr.
Granton, it&rsquo;s no affair of mine.&nbsp;
Only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shuffled away.&nbsp; He had an ugly past known to his
employer.</p>
<p>Symington cursed under his breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;No good for
to-night.&nbsp; Poor Kitty&mdash;it&rsquo;s a pity, but I
can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; Well, to-morrow night ought to settle
it, and if not, I can wait. . . .&nbsp; But I might have gone
North to-night, lifted the stuff, and got back here under
twenty-four hours.&nbsp; Why the blazes didn&rsquo;t I think of
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; His eyes roved as if in search of an answer,
and lighted on the decanter.&nbsp; He glowered at it, and a
flush, almost purple, overran his countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn
you,&rdquo; he suddenly shouted, &ldquo;it was you that kept
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, snatching it from the table, he hurled it
across the room so that it burst into fragments against the
wall.&nbsp; There was a breathless pause till he asked in a
frightened whisper, &ldquo;What the devil made me do that . . .
made me do that?&rdquo;&nbsp; He went to bed without finishing
the drink in the tumbler.</p>
<h2><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> was undoubtedly nearing the
limit of human endurance.&nbsp; Threats and offers of bribes had
alike failed to move the red-faced woman; not one out of a
hundred questions had she answered save by the formula,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t say, Miss,&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to ask himself about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the fourth night of her incarceration, the third since
Symington&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp; At first she had demanded his
presence; later she had implored.&nbsp; The reply was always the
same: &ldquo;Maybe soon; but you must have patience,
Miss.&rdquo;&nbsp; Less than an hour ago she had heard it, and
now the quaint little clock on the wall, which she had sometimes
loved for its &ldquo;company,&rdquo; and sometimes wanted to
smash for its heartlessness, tinkled nine.&nbsp; Was another day
going to pass without relief, another night of awful uncertainty
approaching?&nbsp; She had given up trying to persuade <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>herself
that her captor was not vile enough to carry out his menace
against Colin&mdash;for Colin, she could not doubt, was the
second prisoner.&nbsp; Symington, asserted Despair, was surely
vile enough for the dirtiest work, since he could so torture the
mind of a helpless girl.</p>
<p>And yet Kitty Carstairs was not at the very end of her
wits.&nbsp; One thing she had in her power to do.&nbsp; She could
starve herself!&nbsp; Yesterday she had scarcely touched food;
to-day she had not broken her fast.&nbsp; The tempting meals had
gone out of the room as they had been brought in.&nbsp; There on
the table, with its mocking carnations, was a silver tray bearing
sundry delicacies, exquisitely served, which the woman had left
on her last visit for the night.&nbsp; It taxed the girl&rsquo;s
powers of resistance, but her spirit conquered her flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, hear me,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;let me not
eat till I am convinced that Colin has had food.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
was feeling weak and somewhat faint, but the sickly headache had
abated, and her mind was very clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try once more,&rdquo; she told herself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will pretend to be ill, and that may bring him.&nbsp;
Then I will show him I am determined to starve.&nbsp; I
shouldn&rsquo;t be much use to him dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>Her
finger was on the bell when she heard a sound in the
passage.&nbsp; The bolt was drawn back, and Symington&rsquo;s
voice said: &ldquo;Get to your bed.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to
see you again to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; A rough voice answered:
&ldquo;Right you are, sir.&nbsp; Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Symington entered.&nbsp; He had been keeping himself
firmly in hand all day; he had an exhausted look, and was rather
pale.</p>
<p>Without preface he exclaimed in hurt tones: &ldquo;Kitty,
what&rsquo;s wrong with the food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your other prisoner getting the same?&rdquo; she
asked quietly, approaching the table.</p>
<p>His laugh was lost in a crash.</p>
<p>Kitty had lifted the tray and flung it at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your rubbish!&rdquo; she panted, catching
hold of a chair-back.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he exclaimed furious, then restrained
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep it up, Kitty, my
dear.&nbsp; One day of real hunger is nothing to brag
about.&nbsp; Wait till you see my other prisoner.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
going to take you there now.&nbsp; He has had three days of
it&mdash;and no water since yesterday.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll advise
you not to be foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He winced, but merely said, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>She
did not hesitate even when he took hold of her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a great fool,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand that any decent man would
advise me to commit suicide rather than marry you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo;&nbsp; His fingers crushed her
flesh.</p>
<p>He led her along a passage lit by electricity.&nbsp; A couple
of windows, she noticed, were boarded over with metal-lined
wood.&nbsp; They passed a couple of doors similarly strengthened
and with stout bolts apparently new.&nbsp; They turned a corner
and stopped.&nbsp; The topmost third of the door in front of them
had been cut away, and the opening fitted with slim upright steel
bars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look in,&rdquo; said Symington.</p>
<p>Kitty saw a chamber which might have served as a storeroom in
the past.&nbsp; The shelving had been removed; the walls were
torn and filthy.&nbsp; A table, a chair, and an ancient sofa
constituted the furnishings.&nbsp; A single light hung from the
ceiling.</p>
<p>On the sofa lay a young man, the state of whose raiment
suggested a very long journey without a dressing-case.&nbsp; His
face was grey and pinched; his hands made vague, nervous
movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Colin!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>His
eyes opened, peeringly; he struggled into a sitting posture, and
pressed a hand to his brow,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Kitty!&rdquo; he said, with a laugh
that died abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>A short pause, then&mdash;&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re both
prisoners.&nbsp; But he won&rsquo;t starve you, Kitty.&nbsp;
Well, I hope our jailer is enjoying himself while it lasts.&nbsp;
Oh, you&rsquo;re there, Symington!&nbsp; Kitty, has he told you
about the thrashing I gave him the other night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington turned away with a badly suppressed snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you, Colin?&nbsp; Thank you, thank you!&nbsp;
But, Colin, what am I to do?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s starving you, and
says he&rsquo;ll give you nothing till I promise to marry
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&nbsp; What a gentleman he is!&nbsp; Of course
you&rsquo;ll marry him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Symington roughly.</p>
<p>Kitty held on to the bars.&nbsp; &ldquo;Colin, I&rsquo;m
starving myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake,
Kitty&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Colin rose, but staggered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull through.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t you be
afraid.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only for a little longer,&rdquo; he
said, and got to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me touch your hand,
Kitty, and I&rsquo;ll pull through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; Symington said savagely,
&ldquo;or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>&ldquo;Forgive me, I&rsquo;ve kissed your hand, Kitty
dear,&rdquo; said Colin in a weak, husky voice.</p>
<p>Beside himself, Symington tore her from the door inside which
Colin had fallen.&nbsp; As he left her in her own room he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel and think differently
to-morrow.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t see you till then.&nbsp; Going
now to Dunford.&nbsp; But before I leave I&rsquo;ll supply our
friend with plenty of water&mdash;well salted.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> passage of a motor-car through
Dunford in the night-time was too common a happening to disturb
sleepers or excite the curiosity of a wakeful person.&nbsp;
To-night John Corrie was wakeful, as he so often was till long
after midnight, and it is probable that he was not aware of the
big car&rsquo;s approach till it stopped at his own door.&nbsp;
Being a dealer in motor-spirit, he at once perceived a reason for
the stoppage.&nbsp; More than once in the last few years he had
been called in similar wise to the receipt of custom, though
never quite so late as this.&nbsp; On the last occasion he had,
without opening the door, curtly refused supplies.&nbsp;
Nowadays, however, he could not afford to turn money away at any
hour of the twenty-four.&nbsp; So in shirt, trousers, and
slippers he was into the shop almost as soon as the expected
knock fell.&nbsp; Still, it was better to make certain before
opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do ye want?&rdquo; he called, hand on key.</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>&ldquo;Petrol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened . . . and next moment his arms were behind him while
steel clicked on his wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A single sound by way of alarm, John Corrie,&rdquo;
said a quiet, cold voice, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re a ruined
man.&nbsp; We are not after your money, but we&rsquo;re going to
have the whole precious truth out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker, as the half-fainting Corrie perceived in the
light of a portable lamp, which some one had placed on the
counter, was accompanied by three men, two of them in the garb of
mechanics.&nbsp; The third he recognized as the person recently
inquiring about Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do ye want wi&rsquo; me?&rdquo; he whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your sister?&rdquo; asked Risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her bed.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall do nothing to disturb her, and you had
better follow our example.&nbsp; West, find a chair, and put him
on it&mdash;over at the door.&rdquo;&nbsp; He indicated the exit
to the dwelling-house.</p>
<p>Near the opposite end of the shop, which was fairly spacious,
the mechanics were already busy.&nbsp; On rubber-shod feet they
made scarce a sound.&nbsp; Within the space of a few minutes they
had rigged up a framework, about nine feet square, and stretched
a white screen upon it.&nbsp; Risk unpacked <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>the
contents of a box of polished wood, while West kept guard on the
prisoner.</p>
<p>At last, with a show of courage, Corrie demanded: &ldquo;What
daft-like performance is this?&nbsp; A magic
lantern&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk came quickly behind him.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going
to show you a few pictures, Corrie,&rdquo; he said pleasantly,
&ldquo;and afterwards we shall be glad to hear how they strike
you.&nbsp; Meantime I&rsquo;m going to gag you&mdash;keep still,
it won&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of ten minutes one of the men murmured, &ldquo;All
ready, sir,&rdquo; to which Risk replied, &ldquo;Wait till I give
the word,&rdquo; and stationed himself where he could watch every
movement on Corrie&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; The lamp was put out, but
through the blinded windows a little moonlight filtered, giving a
ghostly touch to the man in the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number one,&rdquo; said Risk softly.</p>
<p>The screen was illuminated.&nbsp; Upon it appeared a face,
that of the late Hugh Carstairs.&nbsp; A glimpse and it was
gone.&nbsp; Corrie gave a jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; muttered Risk, and Kitty Carstairs smiled
and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s visage with an
uncertain grin&mdash;Symington.</p>
<p>Then, for an instant, the screen held a certificate for 500
shares in the Zenith Gold Mines.&nbsp; Corrie <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>sat as if
frozen, but at the next he quivered, for he beheld a portion of a
letter which he knew was in his safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six.&rdquo;&nbsp; Behold! Sam, the postman, holding a
copy of the <i>Western Weekly</i> in one hand and staring at a
letter in the other.&nbsp; Again Corrie gave a jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;&nbsp; A five-pound note of the National
Bank of Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight.&rdquo;&nbsp; A rear view of Corrie&rsquo;s
cottage, a ladder against the ivy, and a man of Corrie&rsquo;s
build reaching into an open window.&nbsp; And then there was a
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Risk, &ldquo;we are going to have a
little cinema entertainment, a scene from a drama of real life
which I believe would interest the public, not to mention the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the door from the dwelling-house was opened a few
inches, silently, unobserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Risk.</p>
<p>What followed was, as the perpetrator would have been first to
admit, a piece of barefaced &ldquo;fake.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet its one
glaring divergence from fact and its several minor discrepancies
could not neutralize the main dire truth of the story.&nbsp; As a
film it had been a costly and difficult piece of work; as a
spectacle it would have impressed <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>any audience.&nbsp; The only
question Risk asked himself now was: Would it attain the single
object to which it had been devoted?</p>
<p>The screen was again illuminated, but not brightly.&nbsp;
Corrie, sweating with apprehension, gazed in a sort of
fascination at the outside of his own home.&nbsp; Soon he saw a
muffled figure which he could scarce have denied as his own, so
familiar it was, even to the slight limp of the left leg, emerge
and steal down the lonely road, with fugitive glances here and
there.&nbsp; It vanished and immediately there appeared a shanty
that might have been the postman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Towards it came
the muffled figure.&nbsp; It passed behind the shanty.&nbsp; A
strangled sound came from Corrie&rsquo;s throat as he tried to
scream, &ldquo;I didna!&rdquo;&nbsp; The familiar figure came
back, went to the door and . . .&nbsp; Corrie shut his
eyes.&nbsp; But he could not keep them so.&nbsp; When he looked
again the shanty was blazing at the rear.&nbsp; Suddenly, the
door was torn inwards and Sam, the postman, or his double,
dropped a hatchet and staggered forth in agony.&nbsp; He reeled
across the road, fell on the grass and lay heaving.&nbsp; Then
into the picture crept the muffled figure, raised a bludgeon and
smote once, twice; knelt, lingered, and rose with a letter in its
hand.&nbsp; Then all movement ceased for, perhaps, ten
seconds.&nbsp; <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>And then, as by an invisible hand, the black muffler
was snatched away, and there was the face of John Corrie, and no
other, a mask of guilty terror.</p>
<p>The prisoner, breaking from West&rsquo;s detaining hold,
pitched forward to the floor, and grovelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are ye doing to my brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; The harsh
voice of a woman startled them all.</p>
<p>Gaunt, ghostly, Rachel Corrie strode forward and halted beside
the miserable creature whom she loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pack o&rsquo; lies!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was me that set fire to the house; it was me that stole the
Zeniths, and sold them to Symington; but I&rsquo;ve got them
back, all but one certificate.&nbsp; Ye cowards! what mean ye by
treating an old man&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She broke off, fell on
her knees and whispered: &ldquo;John, it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;re safe, dearie, quite safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Risk, who had sent the wondering mechanics outside, turned the
key and came over to the group.&nbsp; He stooped and unlocked the
handcuffs, unfastened the gag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Corrie,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry you have suffered this, but it was vital that we should get
at the truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He signed to West, and <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>between
them they lifted Corrie to the chair.&nbsp; He was not
unconscious, but stupefied.</p>
<p>The woman got to her feet and began to chafe her
brother&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said in a low voice,
&ldquo;promise&mdash;swear&mdash;that he&rsquo;ll never be
troubled again, and I&rsquo;ll put in your hands the nine
certificates&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we want even more than that, Miss
Corrie,&rdquo; said Risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do ye want?&nbsp; Money for the other?&nbsp;
Well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A full account of your brother&rsquo;s bargains with
Symington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give ye that, too&mdash;if ye promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we must know at once where your niece
is&mdash;where Symington has hidden her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rachel&rsquo;s jaw dropped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hidden her?&rdquo; she gasped after a moment.&nbsp;
Suddenly she shook her brother, not harshly.&nbsp; &ldquo;John,
what&rsquo;s this they&rsquo;re saying?&nbsp; Kitty hid away by
Symington!&nbsp; Speak, man!&mdash;oh, but surely ye ken nothing
about such a black business! . . .&nbsp; Yet speak, John!&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save yourself from penal servitude, Corrie,&rdquo;
said Risk solemnly, &ldquo;tell me where she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie groaned and hopelessly answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before God, I dinna ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>Risk
and West looked at each other.&nbsp; For once, at least, the man
had told the truth.&nbsp; They could not doubt it.&nbsp; And so
the great effort had ended in failure.</p>
<p>There was a grievous silence.&nbsp; At last West spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, Miss Corrie, you never heard of Symington
having another address than White Farm&mdash;of late, I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel started.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can I trust ye no to hurt him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They assured her, and she ran unsteadily into the
dwelling-house.&nbsp; During her absence Corrie made one
remark.&nbsp; It was characteristic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mill was na insured.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m completely
ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;See!&rdquo;&nbsp; She handed him
the folded paper she had inadvertently taken from
Symington&rsquo;s strong box.&nbsp; &ldquo;And take the
Zeniths,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, the curse
they&rsquo;ve brought to this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the lamp Risk examined the document.&nbsp; Drawing a quick
breath, he said: &ldquo;Miss Corrie, this is our last hope; we
must act on it without delay.&nbsp; As for the shares, you will
kindly keep them till I send you a certificate to take the place
of the missing one, and then you and your brother <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>can deliver
the lot, in whatever way you choose, to Miss
Carstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye would trust us!&rdquo; gasped the woman.</p>
<p>Risk just glanced at the abject Corrie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe
it is what Miss Carstairs would do herself,&rdquo; he said, and
added, with a faint smile: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good sister,
too.&nbsp; Well, you shan&rsquo;t be further disturbed.&nbsp;
Those things&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated the screen and
apparatus&mdash;&ldquo;can be put aside, and I&rsquo;ll have them
taken away later on.&nbsp; Come, West.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a
moment to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the car and, twenty minutes later, the special
train waiting for them at Kenny Junction.&nbsp; And as they were
whirled South, somewhere in Yorkshire, a great train roared past
bearing the sleeping Symington to the rudest awakening of his</p>
<p>life.&nbsp; He had laid himself down in his berth, still
savage with chagrin at his blunder in bringing his two prisoners
face to face before they were sufficiently subdued, yet confident
as ever of ultimate victory.&nbsp; Poor little Kitty!&nbsp;
Plucky though she was, she was bound to give in once hunger and
distress got the upper hand.</p>
<p>Symington, however, had made a second blunder, though he
remained ignorant of it.&nbsp; He had left Kitty with a new
horror to brood on and had thereby rendered her so much more
desperate <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>and helpless; but he had left her, also, a straw, so to
speak, on the flood of her despair.&nbsp; Her intelligence did
not perceive it at once; hours had passed and her spirit was
well-nigh exhausted when it drifted into her ken.&nbsp; She
clutched it because there was nothing else to lay hold on.&nbsp;
Would it serve at all?&nbsp; Was the situation altered by the
fact that her persecutor was going away&mdash;nay, he must have
gone three hours ago!&mdash;for the night?</p>
<p>Suddenly she sprang from the couch.&nbsp; Danger?&nbsp; What
danger would she not dare in order to help&mdash;to
save&mdash;Colin?&nbsp; Her mind was still very clear.&nbsp; She
thought quickly.&nbsp; Then acted.</p>
<p>She switched off the lights, groped her way behind the curtain
to the bed, and lay down.&nbsp; On the wall, convenient to her
hand, was a bell-button.&nbsp; She gave it a long pressure, then
waited&mdash;in vain.&nbsp; Again she rang; again and yet
again.&nbsp; At the end of ten minutes she began to fear for her
scheme, but just then she heard shuffling steps in the
passage.&nbsp; The bolt was drawn, the door opened, and a voice
demanded crossly to know what she wanted at two in the
morning.</p>
<p>Kitty groaned and cried: &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t bear it any
longer.&nbsp; Please bring some food&mdash;bread,
water&mdash;anything.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too weak to get
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the sulky reply,
&ldquo;but you might have taken it when it was there for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the re-bolting of the door Kitty got up.&nbsp; Presently
she was leaning against the wall just behind the door.&nbsp; She
trembled all over; her heart thumped; she feared she was going to
faint.&nbsp; Would the woman never return?</p>
<p>At last she came, threw open the door, and still drowsy and
grumbling, proceeded with an untidy tray in the direction of the
bed.&nbsp; She was at the curtain when Kitty darted from her
corner and out into the passage.&nbsp; Bang went the door, home
went the trusty bolt!</p>
<p>A single light glowed in the passage.&nbsp; Without pause
Kitty ran next door, shot the bolt, to the next again, and
treated it likewise.&nbsp; From within a man&rsquo;s voice called
sleepily: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she had to
take the support of the wall, her hand to her heart&mdash;but not
for long.&nbsp; The trapped woman began a noisy protest.&nbsp;
Kitty went back and said as firmly as she could&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you make another sound, I swear you&rsquo;ll get no
mercy later.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s bolted in too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get out of the basement,&rdquo; bawled
the prisoner.&nbsp; &ldquo;The stair-door&rsquo;s locked, and he
took the key with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Our friends will be here in the <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>morning&rdquo;, Kitty retorted brazenly, &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever see your master again, unless
in the police court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman began to whine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said Kitty, and left her.</p>
<p>She ran to the place where she had seen Colin.&nbsp; Through
the bars she beheld him huddled on the sofa.&nbsp; A large
earthenware jug lay smashed in a pool on the floor.</p>
<p>With her heart overflowing, her eyes half blind with tears,
she tore back the bolt.&nbsp; He did not move at her entrance,
not even when she fell on her knees beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Colin, Colin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hands fell from his white, pinched face and tired
eyes.&nbsp; He regarded her in a vague fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; he said dreamily, &ldquo;by any beautiful
chance, did you mean what you said about your lips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then it seemed the most natural thing in the world that
they should be in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a kitchen and larder somewhere.&nbsp; Are
you able to come and look, Colin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were both pretty shaky, but they went exploring along
that stone passage like lovers in a sequestered country lane.</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>They
discovered a comfortable kitchen, with two basket easy chairs,
and a well-stocked larder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must eat awfully little to begin with,&rdquo; said
the wise Kitty.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you must sit in that nice chair
till I prepare it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They partook cautiously of some very light dainties, and
sipped a little wine and water; and then Colin felt equal to a
wash-up; and then they made love; and then Colin went along to
give the man, who was inclined to be boisterous, a word of
warning; and then they made more love, and talked a little sense
as well; but the sense made them very sleepy and for a space they
forgot even each other; and when Colin woke up he beheld Kitty
preparing something for breakfast; and it was such a delicious
sight to behold her with her sleeves rolled up that he was almost
angry when Risk and West, having forced a silent entrance to the
house, smashed their way down to the basement.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Later, safely at Hilda&rsquo;s flat, Kitty would have thanked
Risk, but he stopped her almost at the first word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Carstairs,&rdquo; he said, with a rueful
smile, &ldquo;I have found out that I&rsquo;m not clever.&nbsp; I
thought I was till I met your aunt.&nbsp; I have to <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>thank her
for saving me from a bitter failure.&nbsp; I believe she will yet
save her unhappy brother.&nbsp; And,&rdquo; he paused for a
moment, &ldquo;I think we may leave Mr. Symington to receive his
punishment from her&mdash;unless you would
prefer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let him go,&rdquo; she cried with a shudder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope I may never see him, or Dunford, again. . . .&nbsp;
I want to ask you a question, Mr. Risk.&nbsp; Do I&mdash;do I owe
you a hundred pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no,&rdquo; he answered meaningly;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the lucky man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Hilda, &ldquo;I was sure of it all the
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colin!&rdquo; exclaimed Kitty before she could prevent
it, and blushed adorably.</p>
<p>Colin turned inquiringly from his talk with West.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, dearest,&rdquo; he said quite naturally, and then
blushed also.</p>
<p>There was an interesting silence till the young man stammered:
&ldquo;By the way, hasn&rsquo;t Kitty told you we were
engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Hilda, when the congratulations
were over, &ldquo;I must say I never thought of Mr. Symington as
a match-maker!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would seem that Rachel Corrie
had forgotten her own weakness in her brother&rsquo;s
collapse.&nbsp; He had risen as usual, but it was evident that he
was totally unfit for the business of the day.&nbsp; Crouched in
his chair by the kitchen fire he presented a sad spectacle of
human misery and shame.&nbsp; It was after nine, and Rachel was
endeavouring to persuade him to eat some breakfast.</p>
<p>With scarcely any warning Symington, coming from the shop, was
upon them.&nbsp; His face was like chalk, his eyes were
congested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corrie,&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, &ldquo;I give you
three minutes to produce my Zenith certificates!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corrie seemed to shrink&mdash;that was all.</p>
<p>Rachel placed herself in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Symington,&rdquo; she said steadily, &ldquo;I took
them, and ye can just make up your mind never to see them
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just for an instant he seemed baulked.&nbsp; Then <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>he said
viciously: &ldquo;Hand them over, or see your brother go to
jail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas me that fired the
postman&rsquo;s house, but that&rsquo;s all settled.&nbsp;
Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glared at her, uncertain how to proceed.</p>
<p>She did not wait for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Symington, two
gentlemen were here last night, and I sent them to a house at
Richmond, Surrey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? . . .&nbsp; Devil, you&rsquo;ve ruined
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; He fairly staggered.&nbsp; He did not ask how
she had learned about the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be there by now, I should say,&rdquo; she
went on unemotionally.&nbsp; &ldquo;A dirty business, Mr.
Symington.&nbsp; If I were you, I would make haste to quit this
country.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a done man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corrie,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
responsible!&nbsp; You sold me the shares.&nbsp; Find me the
certificates at once, or by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna tell all the neighbours about it,&rdquo; Rachel
said quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m responsible.&nbsp; Do what
ye like wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp; But mind ye broke your part o&rsquo;
the bargain by selling some o&rsquo; the shares
secretly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fool, that was no legal bargain!&nbsp; But the law
will recognize your brother&rsquo;s receipt for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>&ldquo;Gang to the law! . . .&nbsp; Man, I can fancy ye
sweating at the sight o&rsquo; a policeman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked death at her then, yet he must still use guile
rather than force.&nbsp; Suddenly he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make terms with you.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll give you a&mdash;a third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep what I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;for
Kitty.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s the end, and ye can just get out
o&rsquo; this and leave me to give John his breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a snarl he sprang, thrust her aside, and reached the side
of Corrie&rsquo;s armchair; Corrie leapt, sank back and became
rigid, the muzzle of a revolver against his temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me the Zeniths!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s countenance was grey.&nbsp; At last she wet her
lips, and said almost inaudibly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch them.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned to
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; whispered the voice of John Corrie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let him shoot.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll keep your honour, and
he&rsquo;ll be a murderer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no caring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the silence steps were heard approaching.&nbsp; The voice
of a girl called: &ldquo;Is Mr. Symington there?&nbsp; A wire has
come for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Symington went to the door and took the orange envelope.&nbsp;
Then closing the door and putting his back to it&mdash;the
revolver still in his hand&mdash;he opened the message.&nbsp; As
he read he <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>seemed to forget the presence of others.&nbsp; His face
took on a bleak, sickly aspect.</p>
<p>This was the message&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At Anchor Line Office, Glasgow, fifty
pounds and ticket await Mr. Granton.&nbsp; One hour after
dispatch of this, instructions will be sent local police.&nbsp;
Bearer Zeniths are now subject to scrutiny at Company&rsquo;s
London office before they can be negotiated.&nbsp; John Risk,
Director.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He read it thrice, and during the third reading he slipped, as
if unconsciously, the revolver into his pocket.&nbsp; For a brief
space he stood motionless, bowed as if in thought.</p>
<p>All at once he turned, opened the door, threw up his head,
squared his shoulders, and went out.</p>
<p>Dunford saw him no more.</p>
<p>John Corrie still carries on business there.&nbsp; His
sister&rsquo;s money, which turned out to be twice as much as he
thought, saved the situation.&nbsp; The only noticeable change in
the man is his open respect for her.&nbsp; She writes to Kitty a
stiff letter twice a year.</p>
<p>Sam, the postman, refused a new house, but accepted from Risk
a &ldquo;soft job&rdquo; in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>On a
night, six months after Symington&rsquo;s disappearance, our five
friends occupied a box at the Planet.&nbsp; The occasion was the
150th performance of the play, which was going as strong as
ever.&nbsp; Anthony West had ceased to grumble at having to
accept a fat cheque every Wednesday.&nbsp; Kitty did not know
what to do with all her money, but, as Risk assured her, she had
still time to think about it.&nbsp; Her marriage day was fixed
for a month thence.</p>
<p>The curtain fell on the last act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for me,&rdquo; said Risk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down in a minute to have a word with
Craven.&nbsp; I may look you up later, Hilda,&rdquo; he added
with a more than usual affectionate glance at his sister.</p>
<p>That afternoon West had called upon him, and made a confession
concerning Hilda.</p>
<p>With leisurely haste the four lovers left the box.&nbsp; None
of them had protested at the idea of not waiting for Risk.</p>
<p>He gazed after them, smiling whimsically, possibly a little
sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;the poor dog got
none.&rdquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
